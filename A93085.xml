         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>New-England</hi> in this reſpect, and what their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary mercies be, thou hast here a taſte, though but a taſte. Theſe notes may well be thought to be leſſe accurate then if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf had publiſhed them, and to want ſome poliſhments and trimmings, which it were not ſit for any other to adde; however
<pb facs="tcp:169490:3"/>thou wilt finde them full of uſeful truths, and mayeſt eaſily diſcern his Spirit, and a Spirit above his own breathing in them.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Author; it were worth the while to write the ſtory of his life.</p>
            <p>It is needleſſe to ſpeak in his commendation, <hi>His works praiſe him in the gates.</hi> They that know him, know he had as real apprehenſions of the things of God, and lived as much with God, and with his own heart, and more then the moſt of Chriſtians do. He had his education at <hi>Immanuel-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The Converſion and Change of his heart was wrought betimes when he lived in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and enjoyed Dr. <hi>Preſtons</hi> Miniſtery, whereby God had the very beſt and ſtrength of his parts and yeares for himſelf. When he was first awakened to look after Religion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before ſwam quietly in the ſtream of the times, he was utterly at a loſſe which way to take, being much moleſted with ſuggeſtions of <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> (in the depths whereof <hi>Junius</hi> was quite loſt for a time) and moved and tempted to the wayes of <hi>Familiſme</hi> alſo; ſome adviſed him in this condition to go to <hi>Grindleſtone,</hi> &amp; to hear <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Brierley,</hi> and being informed that the people were wont to finde a mighty poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, over-powering preſence and work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit when they heard him, he reſolved upon the journey; but God in mercy diverted him, having reſerved him for better things, Yet he read what they ſaid, and the books of <hi>H.N.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169490:3"/>amongſt the reſt, where meeting with this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>That a Chriſtian is ſo ſwallow'd up in the ſpirit,</hi> that what action ſoever the ſpirit moves him to, ſuppoſe whoredom, he may do it, and it is no ſin to him; this was enough: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the light of his natural conſcience, it bred in him an utter abhorrency of thoſe looſe and vile wayes and principles ever after. This advantage alſo he had, that Doctor <hi>Tuckney</hi> was then his Tutor, whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his condition, and had his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and help in thoſe miſerable fluctuations and ſtraits of his ſoul. Happy is the man whoſe doubtings end to eſtabliſhments, <hi>nil tam cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quàm quod de dubio certum.</hi> but when men arrive in <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> as the laſt iſſue and reſult of all their debates and thoughts of heart about Religion, it had been good for ſuch if they had never been borne.</p>
            <p>After his heart was changed, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of him that his abilities of minde were alſo much enlarged, divinity though it be chiefly the Art and rule of the will, yet raiſing and perfecting the underſtanding alſo; which I conceive came to paſſe chiefly by this means, that the feare of God fixed him, and made him ſerious, and taught him to meditate, which is the maine improvement of the underſtanding. Therefore ſuch as came to him for direction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their studies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would often adviſe them to be much in meditation, profeſſing that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpent ſome time in meditation every day
<pb facs="tcp:169490:4"/>in his beginning times, and written down his thoughts; he ſaw cauſe now to bleſſe God for it. He was aſſigned to the worke of the Miniſtery at a ſolemn meeting and conference of ſundry godly Miniſters about it, there were to the number of twelve preſent at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe ſolemne adviſe was that he ſhould ſerve the Lord <hi>in the Goſpel of his Sonne;</hi> wherein they have been the ſalvation of many a ſoul: for upon this he addreſt himſelf to the work, with that reality and ſeriouſneſſe in wooing and winning ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s that his words made deep imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſſions, and ſeldome or never fell to the ground</p>
            <p>He was lecturer a while at <hi>Earles-cone</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> (which I take it was the firſt place of his Miniſtery) where he did much good, and the people there, though now it is long ſince and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are gone, yet they have a very precious &amp; and deep remembrance of him, of the mighty power of God by him to this day. But <hi>W. Lawd</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſoon ſtopt his mouth, and drove him away, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he did many other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ministers from <hi>Eſſex</hi> at the ſame time. After this he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ved at <hi>Butter-chrome</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> at Sir <hi>Richard Darleys</hi> houſe, till the iniquity of thoſe times hunted him thence alſo. Then he went to <hi>Northumberland</hi> till ſilenced there alſo; and being thus moleſted and chaſed up and down at home, he fled to <hi>New-England,</hi> and after ſome difficulties and delays, by great ſtormes and diſaſters at ſea upon the ſands and
<pb facs="tcp:169490:4"/>coaſts of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> which retarded his voyage till another yeare, he arrived there at laſt; where he was Paſtor to a precious flock at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> about fourteen yeares. He was but <hi>46.</hi> or <hi>47.</hi> yeares old when he dyed. His ſickneſſe began with a ſore throate, and then a ſquinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and then a fever, wherof he dyed <hi>Auguſt 23. 1649.</hi> This was one thing he ſaid upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Lord, I am vile, but thou art righteous; and to thoſe that were about him, he bade them love Jeſus Chriſt dearly, that little part that I have in him, is no ſmal comfort to me now.</p>
            <p>His manner of preaching was cloſe and ſearching, and with abundance of affection and compaſſion to his hearers. He took great paines in his preparations for his publick labours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it a curſed thing to do the work of the Lord negligently; and therefore ſpending uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally two or three whole dayes in preparing for the work of the Sabbath, and having his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons finiſhed upon friday night; He hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time expreſt himſelf thus in publicke; <q>
                  <hi>God will curſe that mans labours that lumbers up and down in the world all the week, and then upon Saturday in the afternoon goes to his ſtudy, when as God knows that time were little enough to pray and weep in, and to get his heart in frame, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> He affected plaineneſſe together with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in preaching, not ſeeking abſtruſities, nor liking to hover and ſoare aloft in dark expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſo to ſhoot his arrowes (as many
<pb facs="tcp:169490:5"/>Preachers do) over the heads of his hearers.</p>
            <p>It is a wretched ſtumbling block to ſome, that his Sermons are ſomewhat ſtrict, and (as they terme it) legal: ſome ſouls can reliſh none but meal-mouth'd Preachers, who come with ſoft and ſmooth, and toothles words, <hi>byſſina verba byſſinis viris:</hi> But theſe times need humbling Miniſteries, and bleſſed be God that there are any; for where there are no Law-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, there will be few Goſpel-lives, and were there more Law-peaching in <hi>England</hi> by the men of gifts, there would be more Goſpel-walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both by themſelves and the People. To preach the Law, not in a forc'd affected man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but wiſely and powerfully, together with the Goſpel, as Chriſt himſelf was wont to do (<hi>Mat. 5.</hi> and elſewhere) is the way to carry on all three together, ſenſe of miſery, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the remedy, and the returnes of thankfulneſſe and duty. Nor is any doctrine more comforting then this humbling way of God, if rightly managed.</p>
            <p>It is certain the foundations of after-ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and ruines to the Church, have ever been laid in the dayes of her proſperity, and peace, and reſt, when ſhe injoyes all her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things. This the watchmen of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould foreſee, and therefore what ſhould they do but ſeek to humble and awaken, and ſearch and melt mens hearts, and <hi>warne every one night and day with teares,</hi> that in the day of
<pb facs="tcp:169490:5"/>their peace, they may not ſinne away the things of their Peace. There are therefore three requeſts, which we would deſire to beg of God, with bended knees for <hi>England,</hi> to perpetuate the preſent proſperity and peace thereof; and let us commend them to the mourning and praying ones amongſt us, that they would be the Lords remembrancers in theſe Petitions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> A right understanding and ſober uſe of liberty. For when People come firſt out of bondage, they are apt to be not only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fond of their liberties, but to wax gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and wanton with liberty, and inſtead of ſhaking off the bloody yokes of men, to caſt off at leaſt in part the Government and bleſſed yoke of Chriſt alſo. Hence it comes about that a day of reſt from perſecution, which ſhould be a day of liberty to the Saints to ſerve God, may become a day of great ſeduction, and of liberty to ſeducing Spirits, to deceive, and damne, and miſlead them from the truthes and wayes of God. But the machinations of men, though in conjunction with the powers and gates of hell, ſhall certainly fall at laſt before Truth and Prayer. And of this is the firſt Treatiſe which is ſeaſonably publiſh't.</p>
            <p>To be faſt bound to the rule with all the bonds and cords of God and Man is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of liberty. Hence there is not a ſurer Corner-ſtone of ruine to a Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that God will break them with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd
<pb facs="tcp:169490:6"/>deſtructions by ſome <hi>overflowing ſcourge,</hi> when <hi>the day of vengeance is in his heart,</hi> then to think that Religion is none of their Liberties, and yet how maay ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> are there <hi>void of counſel, neither is there any underſtanding in them,</hi> who <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine vain things,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Let us break his bands aſunder, and caſt away his cords from us?</hi> How do men run into extremes, either ſtretching and paring every one to the Gyants bed, and thereby denying liberty to the Saints to ſerve him, according to the meaſure of their ſtature in Chriſt, or elſe on the other hand opening the door ſo wide, as to plead for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all the diſguiſed enemies and ſins againſt Chriſt, thereby inſtead of uniting the Saints in one, indeavouring through a dreadful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to unite Chriſt and Belial? It is a ſad thing when a man is come to this paſſe, that he is not able to reſolve his conſcience whether <hi>Baal</hi> be God, or the Lord be God, and therefore would not have the worſhippers of <hi>Baal</hi> puniſht, for fear leſt <hi>Baal</hi> ſhould be God. Is liberty no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but indifferency &amp; irreſolution of ſpirit in the things of God? wo to <hi>the valley of viſion,</hi> even to a <hi>ſinful Nation laden with iniquity,</hi> and led away from <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and to <hi>the Hoſt of the high ones that ſit on high,</hi> in the day of his viſitation, if this be the ſpirit of theſe times; for in the day when he viſits, God will viſit for theſe things.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He precious memory of the Author of theſe enſuing Sermons, needs no revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to any gracious heart, that had any knowledge of him. Yea the world knows in part (though but in a little part) by ſome pieces of his formerly printed (while he was yet with us) who this Author was, what it owes to God for him, and how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it might ſigh over his grave, with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Of whom the world was not worthy!</hi> His praiſe throughout all the Churches, is farre above any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by ſo mean a pen as writes theſe lines. But it is not fit that the firſt page of any thing publiſhed after his death (for I doubt not but his death is long ago publickly took notice of) ſhould go without ſome witneſſe of a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:169490:8"/>reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance therof, which indeed no tears can ſufficiently lament. We who ſometimes <hi>ſate under his ſhadow,</hi> &amp; were fed from God by him, (the poor flock of this <hi>Shepherd</hi>) among whom he lived, <hi>teſtifying Repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and whom he ſomtimes <hi>exhorted, comforted and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged every one of us as a father doth his children;</hi> we cannot but carry ſorrow in the bottome of our hearts to this day, that we muſt here ſee his face no more. Neither do we believe that his loſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines with us alone, or only within the limits of this remote wilderneſſe; the benefit (and conſequently the want) of ſuch a burning and ſhining Light, is of more general concernment then we eaſily apprehend, eſpecially in this Age, wherein not only many ſit in utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but which is more, the <hi>new Light</hi> thereof is darkneſſe; and <hi>the Love of many waxing cold.</hi> But we muſt all be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent before Him, whoſe judgements are unſearchable.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169490:8"/>It is inſtantly and not without cauſe deſired by many, that ſuch reliques of his Labours as do ſurvive him, may be (at leaſt ſome of them) imparted to the publick. To effect any thing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable that way, is not an eaſie or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den work. But this ſmall piece being at preſent attained; it ſeemed not amiſſe to let it paſſe the Preſſe. Theſe were ſome of his <hi>Lecture-Sermons,</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt of them in the year 1641. They are now tranſcribed by a godly Brother, partly from the Authors own notes, and partly from what he took from his mouth. The ſubject (in both the Texts) is of great uſe, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for theſe times; wherein there is more Liberty, then good uſe of it; and much more common and outward, then ſaving and effectual knowledge of the word of God. Theſe poſthumous edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are farre ſhort of what the Author was wont to do, and of what the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were in preaching. But though the ſenſe be not every where ſo full, nor every thing ſo thorowly ſpoken to, nor the ſtile ſo good by farre, (as the
<pb facs="tcp:169490:9"/>Authors manner was) yet the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader will finde a precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of truth in it, not fit to be buried or neglected. The <hi>Prophets do not live for ever,</hi> but their words do: The Lord make them ſuch ever-living words as may take hold of all our hearts, not for judgement, but for mercy, for one of theſe wayes they ſhall live; yea, riſe up at the laſt day.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The time of this War is ſet down in the 1. <hi>Verſ. When he had eſtabliſhed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> by wholeſome lawes, erecting Gods worſhip, and countenancing godly men, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 11.16, 17. which continued three years, <hi>and ſtrengthened himſelfe</hi> by fortified places, and munition fit for war, as in the foregoing Chapter appears. Now when he had moſt peace and quiet, he and all Iſrael ſuddenly forſake the Lord, which was the fourth year; and in the fifth year comes <hi>Shiſhak,</hi> and with a mighty hoaſt waſtes all before him untill he come to the chief City.</p>
            <p>Now in <hi>Verſ.</hi> the 5. and 6. is ſet downe the repentanee of the people with their Princes eſpecially. <hi>Shemajah,</hi> who no doubt had ſpoke againſt their idolatrous courſes before, takes his ſeaſon when they were low and tamed, and tells them the true cauſe of their miſery, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. Many ſins there were in the Land, as Idolatry, and Whoredomes, &amp;c. yet the venom was, <hi>They had forſaken the Lord:</hi> Let the ſin be what it will be, yet let it be ſuch a one as men forſake the Lord by it, that's the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; hereupon they humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome effectually, ſome hypocritical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet all outwardly, and ſay the Lord is righteous; they extenuate not their ſinne, they lay not the blame on man, no not on

            <p>There are two parts in the words read.</p>

            <p>God ſets up his government over a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his people do or ſhould ſubject cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to this government; By my ſervice is therefore meant my government, and your ſubjection wrought by me to this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>When people break covenant with God, and loath him, then ſaith the Lord, I'le not feed, and then he ſets over them Idol-ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.</p>
            <p>This is certain, when the ſoule will not ſubjecl it ſelfe to God, he goes about to ſubject God to him, nay to his Iuſts. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.24. <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins.</hi> For one of them muſt ſtoop, and a man would have the Lord be mercifull, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and pittifull to him, when he is in league with his luſts, now this the Lord will not do: And hence, if he does not deſtroy him, he with-draws himſeif from ſerving of the creatune, and hence other evils take hold of it, and bring it under. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:169490:12"/>ſtood, and was for God, all creatures ſerved him, and the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe preſerved him, the Lord communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſweet of his government or ſervice to him; but when he turned away from the right ways of God: Now if the Lord ſhould ſerve him by governing of him in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſhould ſerve a luſt, and bow to the creature, nay to a luſt, which is a vilet thing, then for one creature to fall downe and worſhip another. Therefore now hence it comes to paſſe, becauſe the Lord will not be a ſervant to any mans luſt, there muſt be ſome other government that muſt ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Hence ſet all the Saints in the Churches with their faces ſubjected to the Lord, his good will and righteous wayes, and then his goodneſs ſhall flow down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in and through Chriſt, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we have nothing to do with good, but when we are ſet right for God. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſſe, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in loving kindneſſe and mercy, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord will then command all creatures to be ſerviceable to his Church and people; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21, 22.

            <p>This outward Kingdome Chriſt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth amongſt his people in this world: And this was part of the Lords government over his people herein, though various from our forme now.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Now this was the bleſſed wiſdome of God to put all into ſweet ſubordination one unto another for himfelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every one profeſſing his name is made for God, for Chriſt, <hi>as Lord of Lords, unto whom every knee muſt how,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſubject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence the Lord (it being not good to leave man to himſelfe) erects a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Church with his owne power, and authority, and government in it for that end.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This being poor and ſhiftleſſe againſt inward and outward revenge, hence the Lord ſets up Kingdoms of the world, which either rule for this end or theſe ends or not, if they do not, they are to anſwer it, and ſhall one day to Chriſt, <hi>whom God hath

            <p>Firſt, ſometimes the Lord opens the door of a Kingdome or State, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169490:15"/>of ſome forraign, or it may be barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy breaking in ſometime by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, coming in ſometime by craft, and then ruling like Lions, which the Lord makes to vex and prick the people of God; thus here their lives were ſpared, but liberties loſt. Thus <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>They forſook the Lord, and ſerved Baal and Aſhtaroth.</hi> And in verſ. 14. <hi>The anger of the Lord waxed hot againſt Iſrael, and he delivered them into the hands of ſpoylers that ſpoyled them.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>Whitherſoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was againſt them for evill.</hi> And this the Lord doth many times ſuddenly, that one would never thinke that ever the Lord ſhould be ſo ſudden; the Lord can be as quick to puniſh, as man to ſinne, and that unexpectedly. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Man knows not his time, but are taken like fiſh in an evill net ſuddenly.</hi> Lam. 4.12. <hi>The kyngdomes of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have beleeved.</hi> Judg. 5.8. <hi>They ſet up new gods, and war was in the gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes the Lord turnes the edge of that lawful authority God hath ſet over them againſt themſelves, to be a heavy ſcourge from God upon them: Thus it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Egypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.8, 9. there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a King which knew not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and it's ſaid then they were oppreſſed. Thus <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> whom the ten Tribes choſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.11. he oppreſſed the people, he will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169490:15"/>and this becomes their oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Thus the people under the reign of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate <hi>Solomon</hi> (though their complaint might be in part unjuſt.) Such is the venome of ſin and unſubduedneſſe to the Kingdom God, that the Lord turns light into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and makes an aking head matter of ſorrow to all the ſtate and body of people. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King is a childe.</hi> And one man ſhall do a world of hurt, one <hi>Shebna</hi> or <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and this the Lord doth in juſtice many times for caſting off his government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes the Lord gives a people up into the hands of one another to be mutual oppreſſors of each other that a mans neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall be his oppreſſor. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.9. <hi>I will pitty no more the inhabitants of the land, I will deliver them every one into his neighbours hands. I will feed you no more, that which dieth let it dye, and that which is cut off let it be cut off, and let the reſt eat every one the fleſh of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> Sometimes the Lord is pleaſed to ſend marvellous ſtraits into a place, that men are forced to imbondage themſelves ſometimes by words as bitter as death, as ſharp as arrows; the Lord is pleaſed for the forſaking of his righteous wayes to make a mans ſelf rip his own bowels, the father againſt the childe, the maſter ſhall be a ſcourge to the ſervant, and the ſervant ſhall be a ſcourge to his maſter, weary him of his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169490:16"/>life, the government of the Lord in a mans heart or family being caſt off. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.4, 5. <hi>Truſt not in a friend:</hi> No greater bondage in the world then for men profeſſing the Lord, to be deſperately ſet one againſt another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By taking from a people all that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous power of government the Lord hath ſet over them, when a people deſpiſing the Lord and inward government firſt (for there all begins) and ſo not prizing what they have, nor praying for them, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting to them, the Lord hereupon ſends ſome ſickneſſe, or ſome other evill, that they are either ſuddenly taken away, or gradually, and when they are gone, all ſink, or elſe ſuch croſſe carriages, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, ſo ſay they, <hi>I cannot beare this people.</hi> Thus <hi>Judges</hi> 21.25. <hi>Men did what was right in their owne eyes when there was no King in Iſrael.</hi> No State ſo miſerable as an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, when every one is a ſlave, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one will be a maſter. Thus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1, 2.6. <hi>Be a ruler to us.</hi> No, I'le not undertake to rule. So, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.3, 5. when <hi>without a teaching Prieſt,</hi> then <hi>no peace at all,</hi> men will not be under government of them, you ſhall not have them, they ſhall reſt in peace, and you ſhall then know the want of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By giving them over to Satans, and their own hearts luſts, that ſeeing they will not ſerve the Lord, they ſhall ſerve their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169490:16"/>luſts &amp; their ſins, that now the Lord he hath left off chaſtiſing of men, and conſcience ſhal check no more, proſper, ſaith the Lord, and go on in thy ſin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked after their owne counſels.</hi> Rev. 22.11. <hi>Let him that is filthy be filthy ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Lord ſhall give a man over to Satan, not only to winnow him, to let out the chaffe, and ſo to make the grain the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or to buffet them as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> but to inſnare them, and hold them, that he ſhall not only tempt, but his temptations ſhall take, and not onely take, but hold. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. Who are taken captive by him at his will;</hi> taken alive as a ſnare doth, that now a man is beyond the reach of all means, only <hi>peradventure God may give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Iſa. 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt yet more and more.</hi> The Lord leaves ſmiting, and ſayes, Go on and proſper in thy ſinne: and which is the worſt of all, Satan ſhall ſo blinde him and harden him, fill him with pride, paſſion, lying, hatred of Gods people, cavilling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords wayes of grace, ſlighting of his betters deſpiſing of wholeſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from his deareſt friends, that he <hi>knowes not that gray hairs are upon him.</hi> And after this when God hath caſt out, it may be the Church doth alſo, a moſt fearfull bondage that the Lord gives ſuch a ſoule over unto.</p>

When the whole ſoul thus cloſeth with the will of Chriſt by vertue of the power and Spirit of Chriſt: for if a people ſubmit to the will of their Prince, but 'tis not by vertue of his authority over them, command of them, and helps he hath given them for that end, but it is by reaſon of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power, that underhand incourageth them to yield, this is poore ſubjection.</p>

               </gap>e, the royal ſword and Scepter of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for when Chriſt himſelf is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the kingdome of God is come to that ſoul, and entred into that heart; and hence <hi>Marke</hi> 1.14, 15. the Goſpel is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Goſpel of the Kingdome,</hi> and when <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt preached <hi>believe and repent, for the kingdome of God is at hand.</hi> Under which word is comprehended much, but principally Chriſt Jeſus ready to enter the ſouls of his people; and hence <hi>Iohn</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt. Now 'tis ſaid, thoſe that were effectually wrought upon, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.12. that <hi>the kingdome of heaven did ſuffer violence, and the violent take it by force;</hi> ſo that the kingdome of God is come into the hearts of all the elect of God, when the ſoul uſes a holy violence, and the Lord does draw the heart to an entertainment of the Lord himſelf; Many difficulties there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and Chriſt, and yet they break through all.</p>
            <p>This is the condition of all men by nature, they are ſtrangers to Chriſt, and live without God and Chriſt in the world, and Chriſt from them, and ſo Satan takes poſſeſſion, and rules them, and ſo men are under the kingdome of darkneſſe, ſo that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169490:26"/>the divel himſelf poſſeſſes every natural man, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>he worketh in the children of diſobedience,</hi> and runne on ſo, and remain ſo. Now the Goſpel of the kingdome, and the means to advance Chriſt in his kingdome, makes a free offer of Chriſt himſelf; indeed it offers pardon, grace, mercy, life, glory, but all theſe, are in Chriſt himſelf, and we poſſeſſe them by poſſeſſing and receiving of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as a poor woman hath all the wealth of the man by entertaining of the man. So that the Goſpel firſtly and primarily offers Chriſt himſelf, and faith doth pitch on Chriſt himſelf and doth open <hi>thoſe everlaſting doores, that the King of glory may come in. Iohn</hi> 1.12. 'tis ſaid, <hi>So many as received him, he gave power to be the ſonnes of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the ſon, hath life;</hi> ſo that now let a man refuſe or reject the Lord himſelf as he is thus offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, he does refuſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Lord, and does refuſe to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the Lord. True it may be ſaid the kingdom of God hath been nigh to him, when Chriſt is offered in the Goſpel, and God layes as it were nothing ſhall pleaſe me ſo much as this, if thou doſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>Go and preach to theſe and theſe Cities and if they will not receive you, ſhake off the duſt of your feet, and let them know the kingdome of God hath been nigh

            <p>Now the whole ſoul receives him, when 1. The minde ſees him in the glory of his grace, that though it had low, mean thoughts of Chriſt before, for which it mournes; yet the riſing of this glorious Sun upon him, <hi>he eſteemes all things loſſe for him that he may win Chriſt, and be found in Chriſt, I in him, and He in me,</hi> in Vocation: <hi>and not having my own righteouſneſſe,</hi> in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And <hi>to feel the life of Chriſt and death alſo</hi> in ſanctification, and <hi>to attain to the reſurrection of the dead</hi> in glorification: and now nothing is dear to the ſoul but Chriſt. — 2. When the will, after the ſoul hath had ſome hopes the Lord may look towards it in his grace, and having had many heart-breaking teares before the Lord, the Lord is now pleaſed by the glad tidings of the Goſpel to give the will power not only to receive and entertaine the Lord, but gladly to receive him. The ſoul wonders that ever the Lord ſhould bow down to him, and offer mercy to him; and when as together with this, by the ſweet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169490:27"/>ſavour of his Grace chat he doth let into the heart, the ſoul doth receive the Lord with moſt dear imbracings into his ſoul, that now there is none like to the Lord. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Thy name is like an oyntment pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out,</hi> where <hi>the</hi> very <hi>feet of the meſſengers of glad tidings are beautiful:</hi> But the Lord himſelf is the only crown and Joy of the ſoul, when the leaſt look of love to a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away is more ſweet then kingdoms, ay and much more, that's love it ſelf. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52.9. <hi>Brtak forth into joy, ſing together ye Waſt places of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>for the Lord hath comforted his People.</hi> When kings ſhall ſtop their mouths as vile in themſelves, and not able to ſet forth that glory they never heard of before, and the ſoul for Joy ſells away all to buy this pearl, that it ſayes with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Hon do I love thy Lan!</hi> Now beloved when the ſoul does thus receive the Lord, the kingdome of God is come to that ſoul; and therefore try and examine, is it thus with you? or hath the Lord begun to deal thus with thee, to give himſelf, the glory of Angels, the wonderment of heaven, the mighty God of heaven to come to thy heart? thou art then under the government of the kingdome of God. But now on the contrary if thou canſt be content to receive the ordinances of Chriſt, or the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Chriſt, or ſome of the commands of Chriſt, and that is all, and the Lord never
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169490:27"/>gave thee a heart to cloſe with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it 's a ſtrange thing to thee, that which is the main thing, the Diamond in the Ring of the Goſpel; thou art yet farre enough off from the kingdome of God; I dare not ſay, nor think for all the world, that ever the kindome of God came to thy heart. Again, if you have received Chriſt, but not with thy whole ſoul: that now the offer, promiſes, blood, life, grace, glory in the Goſpel, are grown common things to thee; that the Lord never ſent thee home won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at the glory of Gods grace to a poor wretch, never yet ſaid'ſt, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</hi> the Lord never yet lay next thy heart, or if thou haſt had ſome liking, and ſome love and affections in pangs; yet the Lord is not only precious, and exceeding dear in thy heart, thy heart breaks not for grief that thou haſt ſo much ſlighted him, ſo little born him on thy heart; It is a ſigne that the Lord hath begun to reveal himſelf to thy ſoul, when he gives thee a heart to mourne for thy ſtanding out againſt him, but this never came to thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>Certainly, here is the wound of many men: The Goſpel of God never hath its proper effect, till the Lord help thee to give thy whole heart thus to a Saviour, to a God, to the Prince of peace; and till this is done, the Goſpel is ineffectual, it doth nothing.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169490:28"/>It was a ſweet prayer of him, Make thy Sonne dear, very dear, exceeding dear, only dear and precious, or not at all; If thou hadſt a thouſand hearts, it was too little for Chriſt to love him, and do'ſt grudge him one? when thou haſt imparted thy heart, and eſteem to thy luſts and creature; do'ſt thou love the Lord with part of thy heart? but a vile luſt, a poor creature muſt have a ſhare, and the remnant will ſerve Chriſt, is he not the only pearl of thy heart, to give him daily communion, no this thou art a ſtranger to. <hi>Hear ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh, God will Work, a worke in your dayes.</hi> What is that? the infinit God cannot expreſſe as it were, the wrath that ſhall come againſt ſuch a ſoul; nor I cannot expreſſe the wrath that ſhall come upon ſuch a deſpiſer of the Lord Jeſus. Give him all thy heart or none; if thou haſt the Lord, thou haſt his whole heart; if he had had a thouſand lives, he would have laid them all down for thee: He poured out his blood for every one of his, but for the preſent thou art out of the Kingdom of God to this day.</p>

When the whole ſoul cloſeth with the whole will of Chriſt, having thus received him; for if a Prince become, and people will not be ruled by him, nor any lawes that he makes, though never ſo good, but what they liſt, the Kingdome is caſt off; For, beloved,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169490:28"/>there is a marvellous common deceit in mens hearts, they would not for all the world but have Chriſt; ay, but the will of Chriſt is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that is a clog, and the burden of the Lord of hoſts; Chriſt is ſweet, and his will is bitter; Chriſt is precious, and his will is vile. Why do you make him a King, and ye will make lawes for Chriſt, and you will rule Chriſt, and his will ſhall not ſtand? here is no King; Such kinde of idle Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines were in the Apoſtles time, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If we ſay We have fellowſhip with him, and Walk in darkneſs, we lie, and there is no truth in us:</hi> But now when the whole ſoul does ſubmit to the whole will of the Lord, now his Kingdome is come indeed, when his will is thus ſweet. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>His Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome, and all nations ſhall ſerve him:</hi> and <hi>his ſervants ye are whom ye obey,</hi> whether Chriſt, the devil, or your own hearts.</p>

Lord gives them hearts to lye down at the ſeet of any man that ſhall ſhew them any thing that is amiſſe in them, and they ſay with <hi>David, Lord, ſearch me, and try me:</hi> I have many crooked wayes, and therefore, good Lord, finde them out, and therefore come to the Lord for that end; and though there be ſomething in them that is deſperately contrary to the good will of God, yet there is an inward man that does delight in the law of God, and when the Lord is pleaſed to give them an heart to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169490:29"/>ſubmit to the will of God; Oh the ſoul doth wonder at the Lord, that the Lord ſhould ſhew him any thing, and help him againſt temptations; and though there be a great deal of wearineſſe in the wayes of God, yet there is a ſpirit within him, that it is indeed heaven it ſelf to him to be in the ordinances of God; now ye ſtoop to the directing will of Chriſt, when this is rhy way, though thou goeſt oft out of it, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it again, as ſin is a wicked mans way, although he goeth athouſand times out of it.</p>
            <p>Now, for the other, the correcting will of Chriſt; The Lord hath ſtrong tryals: Now here ſubjection to Chriſt is required as well as to the directing will of Chriſt; then the ſoul ſubmits to this will when the minde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects not, charges not God with folly, as <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good;</hi> And likewiſe the will, though it hath had many ſad bouts, yet this is his frame in the concluſion, that the will of Chriſt is better then every thing elſe, the will of Chriſt is alone ſweet to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. ſaith <hi>Hezekiah, Good is the will of the Lord,</hi> and ſo <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. <hi>It's good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth, and to turne his cheeks to him that ſmites him;</hi> Nay when there is ſpiritual evils on the ſoul, as was on Chriſt himſelf, ſpiritual deſertions, nothing but bitterneſſe and ſorrow; yet the ſoul ſaith, as Chriſt did, <hi>Not my will, but thine

            <p>But if the ſoul will have Chriſt, and yet caſt off the will of Chriſt. 1. Either in his judgement, that the law of God as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Chriſt, ſhould be no rule to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; ſuppoſe you were in <hi>England,</hi> and were there preſt to bow before an Altar, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; what ſhall lead you, if that Gods will and law muſt not be your rule? The Lord will one day make you know, his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will, in that bleſſed law of his, that ye ſhall never finde peace to the end of the world, except the Lord do help ye thus to walke. Again, when men cannot endure the will of Chriſt, cannot endure exhortations, what doth the man mean to exhort us thus? I tell thee, there goeth forth power with the exhortations of Chriſt. I ſay, take heed of caſting off the will of Chriſt here; and ſo when men in their practice ſhall quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of Gods truths, and are loath to ſee it, or if they do, yet not love dearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very truth of God, but it's a burden to them; eſpecially if it croſſe their own ends and gaine, they will not ſee it to be a truth, leſt they ſhould be convinced, and turne to the rule of it; if the will and ordinances of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169490:30"/>Chriſt be a burden to a man, and a man is not wearie of his wearineſſe, but wearie of them all the while: Art thou under the government of Chriſt? If a man forſaken of God, led by his own councels be under the Kingdom of Chriſt, then thou art; ſo long as there is credit for the truth, ſo long it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained; but now ſuppoſe it be coſtly, that it ſhouldbring beggery &amp; affliction with it, is it now ſweet to you? doth this ſupport thy heart? I am in Gods way, canſt lye down and ſubſcribe to the equity of Chriſts proceedings with thee, though he ſhould never ſhew favour to thee; if it be not thus, I dare not ſay thou art under the Kingdome of Chriſt. And ſo for the correcting will of Chriſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſad afflictions the Lord tries thee withall, the Lord tries men marvellouſly; when thou art under the hand of the Lord, thoſe very things that ſhould make men cry to heaven, and wean thee from the world, thoſe very things do harden thee, and make thee grudge and repine. The Lord be merciful to thee, if this be thy frame, the Kingdome of Chriſt never came into that heart; you are begging for mercy; and the Lord ſayes, you mercy? you have abuſed it; no ſaith the Lord, Go to your luſt that have deſpiſed the day of grace, and ſo now you caſt off the Lord, becauſe the Lord will not give you mercy when you would have it. Will you now quarrel with the Lord? no, down proud heart; pray ſtill,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169490:31"/>and mourn ſtill, and turne to the Lord; and ſay, Lord do with me what thou wilt, I am clay in thine hand, thou may'ſt make me a veſſell of diſhonour, I deſerve not the leaſt bit of bread; ſuch a one as is above the Lord and his will, is not under the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubmit thy ſelf to the good will of Chriſt.</p>

And herein Chriſts Kingdome is different from Princes, they give lawes that men may keep them by there own, might; hence they command no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impoſſible things, but the will of Chriſt is ſo croſſe to a carnal heart, that 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible man of himſelf ſhould ſubmit to it: But the Lord doth it for this end, chat the ſoul ſhould then come to Chriſt in its need, that he would do <hi>all the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> and now the Lord himſelf reignes, and that gloriouſly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 1, 2. <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſin and death.</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>A Prince and Saviour, for to give

I anſwer, that is not the queſtion; but hath the Lord made thee willing in the day of bis power? when the ſoul doth lye under the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; when che ſoul doth lye like wax before the Lord Jeſus; when the ſoul
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169490:32"/>ſaith, Lord there was never any change of my nature; the good Lord change it, and if there be any change, the good Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtir up the graces of thy Spirit in my ſoul, and do thou lead me and guide me. Brethren, the Kingdome of Chriſt is come to this ſoul: <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>You will not come to me for life;</hi> He doth not ſay, you do not quicken your ſelves, or ye cannot come to me, but will not; here is their wound, they will not come to Chriſt for life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. <hi>As ye have yeelded your members ſervants to ſin and Satan, ſo now yeeld up your ſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to righteouſneſſe and to holineſſe.</hi> Pſal. 119.5, 6. <hi>Thou hast commanded that we ſhould keep thy precepts continually. Oh that my heart were directed to keep thy precepts continually! Oh that my heart were directed to keep thy ſtatutes!</hi> When a Chriſtian is grapling with his own heart, ye will never be able to overcome the unſubduedneſſe thereof; but when ye bring them to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he would take a courſe with them: 1. Now ye pleaſe Chriſt. 2. Ye take a ſure courſe to have the will of God done, he being in office for that end; for <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and Saviour to Iſrael:</hi> When the ſoul doth look up to the Lord Jeſus, and lye under the power and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus. 3. You now make the yoke of Chriſt ſweet, and his name glorious; nothing glorifies Chriſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169490:32"/>ſo much as this, when Jeſus doth work in a Chriſtian, now the Kingdome of Chriſt is come to the ſoul, and that in power.</p>
            <p>But now when men will not ſubmit thus far to Chriſt: 1. They can do nothing, but will not come to him, on whom God hath laid ſalvation; you ſay, you cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor edifie by the Sermons ye hear, and you cannot part with your luſts. Ay, but now this is thy condemnation, thou wilt not go to a Saviour that he may teach thee and help thee, when men will not have the Lord Jeſus to reigne over them: or 2. If men do come, they will not come to him where he may be found; but ſay, I can do nothing; Chriſt muſt do all, and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the means wherein he will be found: or 3. Will ſubmit and come in means to him, but not then at the ſpeciall time when He is to be ſought, and may be found, <hi>viz.</hi> in time of temptation. But then forget and forſake him, and cry not <hi>Hoſanna:</hi> Lord, now ſave, now help me againſt this luſt; When temptation comes, when paſſion and pride come, do you now go to Jeſus Chriſt? When the world begins to draw thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; doſt thou ſay thus, Lord I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this day againſt this ſin, and Lord I have no ſtrength againſt it, now Lord help me? but here is the miſery of the ſoul, it doth not go to Chriſt, and by this means live in complaints all their life-time. 4. If laſtly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169490:33"/>any thing be to be done , they will do it themſelves, as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.12. Not but that a Chriſtian ſhould put forth himſelf, a Chriſtian is not a dead-hearted Chriſtian at all times, but the grace of God which comes from Chriſt, doth act the ſoul in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dependance on Chriſt; and where Chriſt acts not, there Satan doth. Now I ſay the Kingdome of God is come, when the ſoul doth thus ſubmit to the ſtream of the bleſſed Spirit of the Lord, that the Lord may guide it. Oh beloved, here is the skill, that poſeth the Angels how to tell you; ſo to yield your ſelves to Chriſt, as that Chriſt may come, ſo to abide in the ſtock, that all your fruit may be from him: So to lye under the Lord, as that the ſtream of the Spirit of life may fall on thee; ſo to be implanted in the Lord, as to fetch life from him, and bring forth fruit to him. But try this courſe, ſubmit to the will of the Lord Jeſus, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thy own eyes; and if the Lord do give thee any thing, bleſſe the Lord for it; if any ſtrength againſt thy ſin, be vile in thy own eyes, and try and ſee if ye finde not the Kingdome of God, the glory of Heaven come into thy ſoul. Oh the light, life, prayers you might have, the heavenly conference ye will have together, that it would do a mans heart good to be with ſuch a Chriſtian; that thoſe that are with you might ſay, Verily God is in this man; verily there is joy in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169490:33"/>Heaven when the Saints keep in this frame.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When the ſoul yeelds thus to the will of Chriſt for Chriſts ends; for ſuch is the ſubtil wretchedneſſe of mens heart, that men would have Chriſt glorifie himſelf, that he may glorifie and honour them; like <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> that would give any money for Apoſtolical gifts, that he might be ſome tody that way alſo: Now if a man ſhall ſubmit, go to Chriſt for gifts and parts; that's to ſet up another King, to advance a mans ſelf; and ſo alſo ſin and the devil, and Chriſt muſt be made a ſervant for this end; He is now no King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a Rebel that is not content, that thouſands of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould ſerve him, but he will have the Prince ſerve him alſo: Every man will ſay; this doth utterly overthrow the Kingdom of ſuch a Prince. When a man ſhall ſecretly fight againſt the Lord, and be for himſelf; and for the devil and ſin within; When a man ſhall make all the creatures ſerve him, the ſouldiers of his army; meat, drinke, and outward comforts, this is a marvellous thing; Ay, but when a man ſhall make Jeſus Chriſt, and God himſelf, and profeſſion of Chriſt; make theſe to ſerve him, to raiſe up his name; this the Lord takes very ill.</p>
            <p>Only this I would adde; when the ſoul doth look at Chriſt with a ſingle eye, that Chriſt is ſweet and precious, and lyes under the bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt for that end;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169490:34"/>and now looks up to Chriſt, that he may ſubmit to him with a ſingle eye, that the name of Chriſt may be glorified by life, and death: true it is, ſelf will be in every duty, and ſo is contrary to the Lord in all, and not for the Lord. Yet though it be thus, there is another thing in the ſoul that is wholly for God and Chriſt: and hence ſeeks that he may do his work; his heart loves him, and ſo ſeeks him; and he begs it with many teares. Oh that my children might ſerve and love this God; nay, that all the world might ſee, and bleſſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this God, and the Lord inlargeth his heart herein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.19. and truely now the Kingdome of God is come to thy ſoul. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>As ſin</hi> and Satan do <hi>reigne by death: So Jeſus Chriſt doth reigne by life to eternall life.</hi> Matth. 25.14. He is the true Subject that improves his Talents for the King: Chriſt will ſubdue all his to himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Through the greatneſſe of thy power, ſhall thine enemies ſubmit themſelves to thee.</hi> Rom. 14.17. <hi>For the Kingdome of God is not in meat and drinke; but in righeouſneſſe and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> When a man ſhall be picking fault with things, and this and that offends him; get ye gone, the Kingdome of God conſiſts not in that: But when the ſoul do's go to the Lord, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his peace with God, and love to the people of God, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169490:34"/>here is the Kingdom of God; <hi>He that ſerves Chriſt in theſe things,</hi> the Kingdome of God is come into his ſoul.</p>
            <p>He that thus ſubmits to the Lord Chriſt; he muſt firſt be a man wearie of his own counſels, and muſt loath himſelf: When the Lord hath wearied a man of his own wayes; he ſayes, What am I that the Lord ſhould ſhew me any mercy? And when the Lord calls him to any ſervice; Lord, What am I, that I ſhould now pray to thee? Bleſſe the Lord, when the Lord doth keep thy heart in this frame; but now when men will honour Chriſt, and yet <hi>Saul</hi>-like have Chriſt honour them: Many poor creatures they think it a credit to be in Church-fellowſhip, and they will ſeek to know Chriſt, that they may attaine Church-fellowſhip, and have honour; but know it, till the Lord do pull down thy baſe ends, and make thee loath thy ſelf, and ſo to ſubmit to his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will; truely till then, the Kingdome of God is not come to thy ſoul: Think of theſe things, for if the Kingdome of God be in our hearts, then look for good dayes; Brethren, let <hi>New-England</hi> be confident of it: but if this be gone from the ſoules and hearts of men and women in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall families and places; though they may have the outward Kingdome of Chriſt, yet the inward Kingdome being not ſet up: I ſay no more but what he ſaid, Go to <hi>Palestina</hi>

Therefore dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I do beſeech you, pray and beg for this Kingdome. Thou ſayeſt, I fall ſhort of this: Know this Kingdome of God is at firſt like a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ſome little lying under the will of Chriſt; if it be in truth, bleſſed be God for it; The Kingdome of God is come, and the ſoul doth weep and mourne after the Lord, that the Lord would bring every thought into ſubjection.</p>
            <p>Know it, the Kingdome of God is come to thy ſoul; and know it, thou haſt Jeſus Chriſt at the right hand of God the Father, interceding for thee; therefore, go home and bleſſe the Lord, and wonder at his grace, that hath tranſlated thee from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſſe, to the Kingdome of his dear Son: If the Lord hath let thee finde the beginning of theſe things in truth, go home, and bleſſe the Lord for it.</p>

And for this, the Lord will bring into bondage, <hi>Luk</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>which would not that I ſhould reigne over them; bring them hither, that I may ſlay them;</hi> which is meant of the Lords external adminiſtration by his ſervants.</p>

            <p>This is the maine and firſt Original of all the reſt. Now it is manifeſt, the power of Chriſt Jeſus, the ſupreme power of Chriſt is caſt off; for a man do's profeſſe by this, that not the will of Chriſt, but his own will ſhall rule him; Chriſt ſhall not be Lord, but as they ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more at thee.</hi> When the League and Covenant between Prince and People is broke, then he is caſt off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King; this is certain, the Lord never did receive any people to himſelf from the beginning of the world to this day, but he hath done it by ſome Covenant: Nor never any people took the Lord to be their God, but by ſome Covenant, they bound themſelves to the Lord. Whereby they were either made his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or continued to be his people, and he their God; but I cannot now ſtand to clear this. Now look, as when the Lord breaks his Covenant, he caſts them off from being his people; (though this he never doth to the Elect) So when people break Covenant with him, they caſt him off as much as in them lyes, from being their God; they do as much as in them lyes, make the Lord to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169490:37"/>be no God. You ſhall ſee therefore, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.3. <hi>They ſay, we have no King; becauſe we feared not the Lord.</hi> It is the ſpeech of Conſcience, and that at a ſad time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did not fear the Lord; <hi>They have ſpoken words, ſwearing falſly, and breaking the Covenant.</hi> In their time of Covenanting with the Lord, there ſeemed to be much ſorrow and humiliation; yet in theſe very Covenants, <hi>Hemlock did ſpring up,</hi> and hence captivity came. Many times the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants that are made, there is ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeeming reality; that not only men, but the Lord ſpeaking after the manner of men, He thinks certainly theſe Promiſes, theſe Covenants will never be broke; yet they are broken. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.8, 9, 10. <hi>I ſaid, ſurely,</hi> ſaith the Lord; <hi>This is a people that will not lie.</hi> Such profeſſion, and ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements, &amp;c. ſo it is ſaid; <hi>In all their afflictions, he was afflicted, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of his preſence did redeem them: But</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit:</hi> They caſt off the Government of the Lord, they would not be under the bonds of the Lord, and <hi>ſo he was turned to be their enemie;</hi> this is that which brings captivity and bondage. <hi>Jerm.</hi> 2.14, 15, <hi>&amp;c. Is Iſrael a ſervant, ſaith the Lord?</hi> ye ſhall ſee the reaſon why he was ſo; <hi>I have broken their iron yoke,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and I have burst thy bonds, and I have planted thee a noble Vine; yet haſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169490:37"/>thou degenerated:</hi> and this is that which doth make them vaſſals or ſlaves. And in truth you never ſee Churches laid deſolate; but when that time comes, men ſhall ſee, and ſhall profeſſe it. When other Nations ſhall aske; Why hath the Lord dealt thus with his people? The anſwer ſhall be clear; They have broken the Covenant of the Lord. When many miſeries come upon particular perſons, what is the cauſe of it? then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Covenant thou haſt broken with the Lord. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.5, 6. <hi>They have tranſgreſſed the Law,</hi> ſpeaking of the whole earth; <hi>And they have changed their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and broken the everlaſting Covenant.</hi> A people that might have had everlaſting mercy, they would not ſubmit to the Lord, they have broken this everlaſting Covenant of the Lord: Now what followes? <hi>The earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;</hi> and hence heavy things that are there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſhall befall the whole world; It is a ſin that defiles the earth men tread on, and the houſes men inhabite in, for it is a ſinne againſt moſt light: They which make Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants have a great deal of light, and alſo moſt will. And that do's aggravate a ſinne; when the whole heart, as it were, do's give up it ſelf to a luſt, and breaks hereby all bonds. And it is a ſin that men might avoid, if they would be watchful againſt: For it is a ſinful thing to make a Covenant of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169490:38"/>things, therefore it lyes heavie on the conſcience of men afterwards; I might have been better, and might have walked better; Nay, it is a ſin that do's deſtroy the Law of the Lord: this ſin it do's deſtroy the very will of Chriſt. Had'ſt thou never been bound in Covenant; had'ſt thou laid by this Covenant, the will of God had been kept whole. As cords not uſed, are kept whole; but when broke, are utterly ſpoiled. When a man do's bind himſelf by a Covenant to the Lord, and then break it; he do's as much as in him lys, to deſtroy the Lord from being King.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Saints and people of God may be ſaid in ſome caſe to break Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but yet they never impenitently break Covenant with the Lord; they may break Covenant with the Lord very often, but yet it is with them as thoſe in <hi>Judges</hi> 2.1, 4. When the Angel of the Lord came to them, and they were under grievous ſad bondage; faith he to them from the Lord: <hi>I have brought you up out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and I have broke your bonds; and I have ſaid, I would never break Covenant with you: and I ſaid, you ſhould make no League with the</hi> Canaanites, <hi>but ye have not obeyed my voice; why have ye done this?</hi> And all the people heard this; and it is ſaid, <hi>All the people wept.</hi> Doubtleſſe ſome were ſincere, though happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many were full of hypocriſie; and ſo the ſincere heart laments it, and renewes his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169490:38"/>Covenant. The poor ſoul hath nothing to ſay many times, though the Lord ſhould bring never ſo much miſery on it; yet the ſoul ſtands weeping before the Lord, that it hath broke the Covenant of the Lord, and made void the Covenant of the Lord; yet the Saints they never break it wholly, they never depart wholly from the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now when a people ſhall impenitently break Covenant, as hath been ſaid: that men can ſtudy arguments, how to nullifie Church-covenant; nay, worſe when in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then ever before; and the buſineſſe is, they are loath to be in bonds; when men ſhall grudge the truth of the Lord, others if their judgements be not ſet againſt it; yet notwithſtanding, in deed and practice, they live as if they had never been in Covenant. Once they were a pleaſant plant; but now they are degenerated, as the Lord doth there complaine. Beloved, when it is thus, the League between the Prince of peace, and the Church is broke; they do as much as in them lyes, ſeek to caſt off the Lord from ruling over them.</p>

When there be additions made to the Ordinances of Chriſt, by humane ordinances and inventions of men; let any ſet up new ordinances, new inventions of men, they ſet up new gods; and they do as Subjects ſet up new Kings, which is indeed to pull down him that was, and ſo they do to Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169490:39"/>they do deny the ſupreme headſhip of Chriſt, and his authority over them; though it may ſeem a ſmall thing, yet thus it is: And hence ye ſhall obſerve <hi>Jeroboams</hi> calves, though they worshipped the ſame God which was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> varying only in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; yet the Lord profeſſeth, that <hi>they had ſet up new Gods,</hi> and ſo indeed did pull down the true God and his government from over them, and this brought bondage. And hence, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Let no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile you of your reward with a voluntary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and worſhipping of Angels, intruding into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatſoever pretence be upon the inventions of men, take heed of that; if it be the <hi>inventions of men,</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>and not holding the head;</hi> the very headſhip of Chriſt is denied, and the ground is this; To ſay that Chriſt is not a ſufficient means of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of ſaving his people, and ruling his people; it is to deny the headſhip of Chriſt: and likewiſe to ſay, that Chriſt hath not appointed for his people ſufficient means for that end; is to ſay, that Chriſt is not a ſufficient means to rule his people; and he that ſhall ſay, Jeſus Chriſt is not a ſufficient means, he do's deny the headſhip of Chriſt. Now to ſet up any inventions of men in the worſhip of God, to be a means to carry the heart to God, is to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169490:39"/>hath not appointed ſufficient means for that end; and therefore he is not a ſufficient means of guiding, and ſaving, and ruling his people. Nay, this I will adde; let there be any invention added to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, that's meerly the will of man; nothing elſe, but only this I would have ye do it; they are ſuch things as do neither make a man better nor worſe, but only uſe them, and ye are commanded to uſe them, and nothing but the will of man: This is to ſet up a new Chriſt, and to pull down the power of Chriſt Jeſus, to ſubmit herein to the authority of man, meerly becauſe of the will of man, that there is nothing ſeen but his will: There is (it may be) neither good nor hurt in it; It is to make that man a God and Chriſt; it is peculiar to Chriſt to do it, and this do's pull down the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt from his throne; when there is adding to the worſhip of the Lord. I need not I ſuppoſe ſpeak any thing this way; On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember to be watchful againſt this; when the Lord doth ſend tentations this way into Churches, or into any place; be watchful againſt new inventions of men to be added or made, they are very ſinful; and if ye ask me when we ſhall look for ſuch times; I need not go farre from my Text.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169490:40"/>enjoyment of them: Whenſoever ye ſee this, that they are caſt off on this ground, then look for bondage; for it will come on whole countreys in general, and on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons: For Jeſus Chriſt is in his Ordinances, and his Throne is not only in Heaven among the Angels; but, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.7, 8, 9. <hi>He ſits on the throne of David,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Church and People; and pull theſe down, you pull down Chriſts throne, <hi>the Prince of peace;</hi> when ye pull down his Ordinances. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. there were many that did ſeem to be for Chriſt, and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, this is one ſigne by which he notes them; <hi>They went out from us, for they were not of us: that it might be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they were not of us.</hi> Now I ſay, when men ſhall pull down the Ordinances of Chriſt, and withdraw themſelves from the communion of Saints; and when it is for one of theſe ends, in regard of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evil that the Ordinances do bring with them, or ſome outward good they ſhall get by caſting them off; then certainly look for bondage. As a Prince that hath one near him, he may attempt change of things in State; but when he is ſet a work by a forreigne State, and is a penſioner to the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Spaniard:</hi> Now he is reall to root out the Prince; and this provokes.</p>
            <p>So here, many times a Chriſtian, he may in conſcience ſpeak againſt ſome of the ways
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169490:41"/>of the Lord, and this may be the condition of the Saints and people of God, and they may ſpeak it in conſcience; and this may be tolerated, when it is for want of light; nay, they may through ſtubbornneſſe of ſpirit, caſt off Ordinances; but when now it is for this reaſon, though he hath indeed his colours for it; you ſhall, ſaith Satan, have this gain, and this eaſe, and theſe conveniences; and what do you do with Ordinances? and now a man begins to finde out arguments; and ſaith, Satan, If ye attend to the enjoyment of Ordinances, here be theſe miſeries, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore away with ſome of Gods Ordinances at leaſt. Oh, brethren, when it is thus, that there is this ſecret penſion from the world, that now had the Lord Jeſus, the honours of the world attending on them, then they could make much of them; but becauſe they come with poverty, therefore they can plot and ſpeak againſt them, and in time come to caſt off the Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus; It is certain the Lord bath bondage for ſuch ſoules, and you will certainly finde this true one day. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14, 15. The people, they ſay; <hi>What profit is it that we have ſerved the Lord, and that we have walked mournfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him?</hi> and hence, they forſook the Lord; Hence, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1, the Lord threatens, that <hi>He will burn them up, both root and branch.</hi> The Lord hath conſuming fire for ſuch one day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:169490:41"/>The Ordinances of the Lord were too coſtly for you. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>The Lord hath his Vine-yard, he lets it out to huſband-men, and he ſends for the fruit; and at laſt the ſon himſelf comes to call for fruit.</hi> Now ſay they; <hi>Here is the ſon, let us kill him.</hi> Why, what is the matter? out of gaine, that is the buſineſſe; <hi>That the inheritance may be ours.</hi> Here is this gaine to be without them, and therefore to caſt off Chriſt: <hi>What will the Lord do to theſe huſband-men? he will take away his Vine-yard from them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the ſpeech of <hi>Luther, Venter in omni religione potentiſſimum Idolum:</hi> When the Belly is ſerved, Chriſt muſt be deſtroyed. Men may have this quiet life without theſe Ordinances; and hence men bear a privy grudge againſt the Ordinances of the Lord, becauſe the belly is not ſerved. Look as it was with the Jews; they looked for a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King to come to them, and Chriſt came; and though they were told of it before; when he came, he had nothing but his Croſſe; and he tells them, <hi>If they will be his Diſciples, they muſt take his Croſſe.</hi> But now, becauſe he came not with pomp, but only with his croſſe, this is the great reaſon; why to this day the Jews do ſet themſelves againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the Croſſe came with Chriſt, that's the cauſe of it: So when men ſhall look for great things from the Ordinances of Chriſt, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169490:42"/>when they come to enjoy them; they meet with nothing elſe but Chriſt and his Croſſe, and diſappointments, and deſertions; when they meet with this, then Chriſt is caſt off, and they profeſſe he is no King, and <hi>Ceſar</hi> is our King: and if we take this man to be our King; the <hi>Romanes</hi> will ruine us.</p>
            <p>I know it is a hard trial for a man to be put to ſuch a ſtrait; for the Lord to advance the price of his Ordinances at that high rate, that all muſt be parted with for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. But yet notwithſtanding, he is for ever unworthy to have the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to rule him, that ſhall therefore make him a King as they did, <hi>John</hi> 6. He was their Cooke, therefore they made him King. Therefore this I ſay, take heed of diſputing againſt, or denying, or nullifying, not only outwardly, but in thy very heart ſecretly, any of Gods Ordinances: for that the Lord complains of his people, that <hi>their hearts went after their wickedneſſe.</hi> Oh take heed of doing thus againſt any one of Gods Ordinances, becauſe ſtraits do attend on them: It was the ſpeech of <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 119. <hi>Thy law is pure, therfore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou ſhouldeſt never get any good by any of Gods Ordinances; yet <hi>thy law is pure,</hi> the fault is in thy own heart; and certainly the Lord he will reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, as there he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I remember the love of thine eſpouſals, when thou didſt follow me in a land

            <p>But now when men have found the Lord in an Ordinance, ſubduing ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſin: there are other ſins remaining in their hearts, and they ſtand unremoveable in their hearts; and hence, are the ſtrongeſt and deareſt of all the reſt: Now, I ſay, when men having theſe ſins, and knowing theſe ſins in their hearts and ſpirits; when as, becauſe I cannot ſubdue theſe ſins; and they have attended on the Lord in the uſe of means, and the Lord helps them not; and becauſe, they hope to be ſaved at laſt for all theſe: Hence they come to a truce with their ſin, and never go mourning to the Lord; nor ſay, the Lord hath begun to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſome of theſe luſts: Now Lord, go on, but the ſoul is at truce with his ſinnes. Beloved, if there be any pollution of the Ordinances of the Lord, here it is; that men come with unbroken hearts to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord; that never feel your need of them, and wounds and ſores that are in your hearts, that men do ſtand with thoſe very ſins, that they think they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due; and becauſe, they cannot eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of them, therefore they give way to them. When men keep theſe ſins with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible hearts of them, ye do reſiſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, ye feel not your need of the Lord; therefore ye keep your ſins, and your woes you ſhall have for them.</p>

It is ſaid, <hi>Every thing that touched the Altar, was clean;</hi> and hence, without this, all is unclean: When a poor ſoul ſhall come to the Lords Ordinances, and prepare himſelf before he come; and in all, it hath many weakneſſes, yet it doth leave it ſelf with Jeſus Chriſt; every thing that doth touch this Altar, is ſanctified, and is not polluted. But now when men ſhall enjoy Ordinances, and make no great matter of ſins in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; eſpecially if ſecret: ſuch is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous nature of ſin, it doth defile the earth a man doth tread on: Now when men ſhall have theſe ſins, and know them, and yet never leave themſelves with Chriſt, and lay themſelves on this bleſſed Altar by faith; they do pollute the Ordinances of the Lord.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, When the ſoul doth not ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, manifeſtly drive away the Lord; but when men ſhall come to the Ordinances, and never come to the Lord Jeſus in them; now the Lord is caſt off. A great Prince that comes to a mans houſe, though he be not driven out of doors; yet if not attended
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169490:45"/>on, he accounts himſelf caſt off. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in his Ordinances, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.35. <hi>The Lord is there;</hi> the Saints, they come to God in them, and are carried to him by them: Therefore, 'tis ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33, 34. <hi>Now therefore, we are all preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God,</hi> and Pſal. 84.7. <hi>Every one of them in</hi> Sion <hi>appeareth before God.</hi> Now the Saints and people of God, when they do thus come to the Lord, they finde many difficulties to break through, <hi>a vallie of Baca.</hi> Sometimes their heart is turned from the Lord, and ſometimes God is turned from them: ſo that now, the Saints when they do come to the Lord in his Ordinances; <hi>They go through the vallie of Baca,</hi> that they may ſee God in <hi>Sion.</hi> But now, when men do never break through difficulties; but give way to a ſluggiſh heart; when it is thus with a people, it is certain the Lord is now caſt off; and ye do as good now as live without Chriſt in the world. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.21. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I hate your new Moons, and Sabbaths; For theſe fourty yeares ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſacrificed to me,</hi> verſ. 25. Did they not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice thoſe fourty yeares to the Lord in the wilderneſſe? It was the very thing they came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> for, that they might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Lord: Yet ſaith the Lord, ye did not ſacrifice to me; truely here was the thing, they did ſacrifice, but, to enjoy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169490:46"/>with a God, that they did not; the Lord he ſaw none of that, and this is the frame of many a man, ye never heard a Sermon; ye never broke through your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties to come to a God in Ordinances: therefore, in truth, though you had them, yet it is as if you never had them; becauſe, ye never did enjoy the Lord in them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this is that I would ſay: Oh, Brethren, let the Saints, let it be the care of all the faithful and people of God; the firſt thing that ye do, before ye come to hear a Sermon, or receive a Sacrament, or to any Chriſtian communion, or other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God: Before thou do'ſt come, indeavour it at leaſt co bring thy ſoul to a God, to Chriſt, above all Ordinances, and break through the difficulties; heart is dead, and minde is blinde, and God is gone; but yet break through difficulties, and wreſtle with the Lord in prayer, and then ye will finde the bleſſing of the Lord. The great reaſon why we enjoy not that mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord in his Ordinances, it is this; Men come to Ordinances, and would enjoy Ordinances, but they never broke through difficulties, to come to a God: When men ſhall come to Ordinances only, (and bleſſed be God we have the temple of the Lord;) truely this will do you no good in the world.</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169490:46"/>power of Chriſt in his Ordinances; many times when the ſoul cannot come to Chriſt, the Lord comes to it: Now then the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of Chriſt is caſt off, when the ſoul is unwilling or careleſſe, to receive the ſtroke of the Eternall power of the life of Jeſus into his heart; but contents himſelf with ſome beginnings, ſome ſips and taſtes, and doth not lye under the ſtroke of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spirit of the life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Look as it is with a company of Subjects, they are in ſome great Town, that ſtands it out againſt a Prince; If the Prince ſend to them, and they parlie with him , and they are thankfuil for his gifts, and glad of his parlie; but yet notwithſtanding, they are unwilling to receive the Prince, with all his power to come into the Town; if they be unwilling to do that, and are loath to joyn ſides againſt the other party, they caſt him off from being King: So it is here, when men come to the Lord in Ordinances, the Lord he parlies with them, the Lord he ſends promiſes, and they are marvellous precious things; and they have ſome taſte of what the Lord do's ſend, and it is ſweet to them; But now, becauſe they have luſts in their hearts; the Lord ſaith, make warre againſt thy luſt, and open the gates that I may come in: If ſo be, a man now out of ſecret love to his ſin, he content himſelf with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt; but the life of Chriſt, he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169490:47"/>cares not for that, he uſes not ail meanes that he may finde that, the ſupreme power of the Lord Jeſus is now caſl off, and I know no difference between ſuch a people and <hi>Capernaum;</hi> they did enjoy the Goſpel of God, but now to entertain the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in his ſpiritual power, this they were loath to come to; therefore, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Wo to thee Capernaum;</hi> the mighty work of Jeſus Chriſt in their hearts, this, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cared for. Saith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>The weapons of our warfare, they are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through God.</hi> As poor things as you think the Ordinances of the Lord to be, they are mighty through the Lord: When Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhall not be willing to receive this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt truely, now the Kingdome of Chriſt is caſt off. <hi>John</hi> 6.49. <hi>Your fathers are Manna in the Wilderneſſe, and are dead,</hi> that was outward Manna; but he that eateth me, ſhall live for ever.</p>
            <p>In one word thus; this is certaine, a man never gets good by any Ordinance, nor the Lord Jeſus doth never attainc his end in any Ordinance, till there bean everlaſting power and life of Chriſt Jeſus communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Ordinance. <hi>There,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God commandeth his bleſſing,</hi>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169490:47"/>doth receive any good till he doth it: For If a man be healed of his blindneſſe, and be blinde preſently again; what is be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? So, if a man hath ſome flaſh of light in the Ordinance, bleſſe the Lord for it. The Lord quickens up the heart to walk with the Lord, Bleſſed be the Lord for it: Ay, but when the heart now ſhall loſe that life, and ſtrength which it had, (not but that a Chriſtian do's loſe to his feeling, but it will returne again.) When he is a hearing, ſome affection, but he goes away dead as he came: no, but when the Lord comes by his everlaſting power and mercy, and life in any Ordinance; now Chriſt comes in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and now ye receive the King in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Chriſt attaines his end in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. This is all that I would ſay, I do beſeech you brethren, in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Oh ſeek for this bleſſed life, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life Lord, everlaſting power Lord; beg for that, and ſeek for that, and pray for that, and weep for that; do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy ſelf with ſippings and taſtings, look for everlaſting life and power to come with the Ordinance; though means be weak in themſelves, do not therefore vilifie them: Look upon the brazen ſerpent, what a poor thing was that to heal the people that were ſtung? yet the inſtitution of Chriſt did put vertue into it: So do thou attend on the Ordinances, and never be content, till
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169490:48"/>thou doſt finde the Lord, and feel the Lord, and ſay as ſome have ſaid; though I feel not the Lord now as I have done, yet I think I ſhall for ever bleſſe the Lord. Never be content till ye finde the Lord bringing your heart to this paſſe, and then the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Prince of peace is come; though ye finde not the fame power at all times, yet if ye finde that power which do's inure your heart for ever to bleſſe the Lord, here is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting power. Jeſus is now come to thy ſoul; Ay, but when ye content your ſelves with ſome movings and beginnings; and ſin and Satan as ſtrong again as ever, and ye finde not your ſin waſting and conſuming; in truth the Lord Jeſus is caſt off, and ye have not the end for which ye come to the Ordinances of the Lord.

There is a derivative power of Chriſt to the Church, joyntly conſidered together. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Go and tell the Church,</hi> is the higheſt tribunal Chriſt hath on earth in the Kingdome of Saints. 'Tis Chriſts high Court of Parliament, beyond which there is no appeal to any higher power then the Church; and it cannot be meant of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Church (which is the faireſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation). For the caſe may be that there is but one Officer, and is he the Church? as alſo that he may ſin, and not hear of his ſin, and muſt they leave him to himſelf, at

            <p>For the clearing up of this, know that there is a threefold derivative power, which the Lord bath given to the Church joyntly, and not to Elders only: Which may be miſerably abuſed, and ſo provoke the Lord to take it away from their hands till they know better how to uſe it; yet when 'tis uſed according to Chriſt, now not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of it, which is Chriſts power delegated to it, is to caſt off Chriſts Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I am confident, the bondage of all the Churches in Chriſtendome; if ye examine the Churches, is continued, becauſe the Lord ſees hearts unwilling to ſubmit to him in the government of Churches; and will continue it till Churches know how to uſe it, and men lye down to the power of it.</p>

They have a power given them from Chriſt, of opening and ſhutting the doores of the Church, the Kingdome of God on earth: <hi>i. e.</hi> of letting in, and keeping out any according to Chriſt; into, or out of their communion: and this I conceive to be one part of the power of the Keys, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church: The chief office of which, is to open and ſhut; to receive in,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169490:49"/>and keep out according to Chriſt; and hence the three thouſand were added to the Church, though the Apoſtles were guides therein: and <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26. <hi>Paul</hi> would have joyned himſelf, but they would not accept of him; becauſe, they were afraid of him. No body natural or politick, but they have power to receive to them the uſefull, and keep from them the hurtfull; ſo, much more Chriſts ſpirituall body.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169490:49"/>will not be known of it; they appear bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they are, and hence they are loath to be ſeen and judged as they are: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is to caſt off Chriſts power; and if continued in, the ſalvation of your ſoules is alſo caſt off: <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>ult.

Now when mens love grows cold, that a godly man is not eſteemed whiles he lives, nor his death lamented ſo much as the loſſe of a ſwine.

            <p>Now, when theſe are not uſed, or not with a ſpirit of meekneſſe improved, that a man never bleſſeth God for theſe; the Lord Jeſus is pulled down from his throne, when not done according to the ability, time and place that the Lord affords. And this I wiſh, the Churches mourn not for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day: For my own part, I do adjudge my ſelf before God and men; as moſt guilty
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169490:55"/>of this, that I enjoy many ſweet Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and we improve them not; and hence, the glory of the Lord fills not his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, abides not on his Churches, either to draw others to them , or to make others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly bleſſe God for them.</p>

As take a plaine countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he neither ſeeks or regards the affaires of the State in publick, becauſe his ſpirit and condition is low; but Princes do minde and attend to the affaires of the Kingdome, to advance it; becauſe their condition is high, and they know it.

               </gap> if all were Schollers, Miniſters, or Saints glorified, they could then eſteem them. Hence, <hi>Eph</hi> 4.16. Edifying is by love; <hi>Making increaſe of the body, edifying it ſelf in love.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>From want of being poor in ſpirit,</hi> and ſenſible of their extream need of Chriſt continually in all means: Beggers will pick up crums, and watch for a word of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6. <hi>A little childe ſhall lead the Wolfe and the Lion;</hi> that is, when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169490:56"/>the Lord hath humbled the heart of a man. Oh, when a Chriſtian thinks none ſo poor and ſhallow, and heartleſſe as I, and every one is better then I, however I need more then any: This ſoul will be glad to ſuck the breſt; and the Lord will fill others with light and life, and his own bowels, to do ſuch a one good. Whereas, elſe they are ſhut up, and they finde no good conveyed to them by any of the Ordinances of the Lord, nor any preſence of God in them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. There is a Miniſterial power, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Chriſt by the Church to the ruling Officers thereof. I ſay, by the Church; for all power in the Church, is properly Chriſts, yet he nextly communicates it ordinarily to his Church, or multitude of Beleevers, to whom is committed the ſupreme power of the Keyes in his word, and of binding and looſing, as hath been ſhewen; and by this Church, this power hath been by Chriſts appointment, and ſtill is, to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe that are choſen out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be Officers and Rulers over them in the Lord, to exerciſe the power of Chriſt over them according to his will. Hence the very power of binding and looſing, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſhutting, given to the Church, is alſo given to <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the ſucceſſors of Chriſts Apoſtles in Doctrine, ſent of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 20.23.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169490:57"/>
               <hi>Whoſoevers ſins ye remit, they are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe, though the power of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of it is in the Churches hand, yet the power of uſual adminiſtration of it is in their hand, whiles they exerciſe it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, yet by the Church. And hence <hi>Paul</hi> puts a difference between this extraordinary Miniſtery, as Apoſtleſhip, and ordinary. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>An Apoſtle not of men, nor by the will of men, but by Christ,</hi> for the Church, not by it: Now this I ſay, is by the Church from Chriſt. Hence, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>The holy Ghoſt hath made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers;</hi> ſo that 'tis no invention of man, or act of man, or the power of man; but of Chriſt, and hence refuſe to be under this power; men caſt off the yoke and power of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>For though the eſtate of the Church be <hi>Democratical</hi> and <hi>Popular;</hi> and hence no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick adminiſtrations or Ordinances are to be adminiſtrated publickly, without notice and conſent of the Church; Yet the government of it under Chriſt, the Mediator and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of his Church; tis <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> and by ſome chief, gifted by Chriſt, choſen by the people to rule them in the name of Chriſt, who are unable, and unfit to be all Rulers themſelves; and to caſt off theſe, or not to be ruled by theſe; is to caſt off Chriſt. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that rejecteth you, rejecteth me.

That look as Common-wealths are under greateſt bondage, where there is an Anarchy, where every one muſt be a ſlave, becauſe every one muſt be a Maſter; So in the Churches, no greater bondage can come then this, the foundation of all confuſion, and the ſcandall of the wayes of God which through mercy his people here enjoy.</p>

            <p>Hence alſo, when men ſhall cry for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak, an Elder forbids it; What, may not the Church have liberty? true, but you are not a Church. An Elder reproves, &amp; they will reprove again; What, ſhall not the Church have liberty? An Elder gives reaſons ſtrong, and unanſwerable for ſome thing to be done; a young fellow ſhall ſtep up, and ſay, without ground, or ſhew of it, that's your light, and mine is otherwiſe: What, may not the Church have liberty?

And that not as unto other Chriſtians, but as unto an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſtampt with an authority of God upon them; indeed they are not to do any

            <p>'Tis true, they are but ſervants to the Church, becauſe they are by the Church, for the Church, and to help the Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. and are ſubject to them if they ſinne; but yet they are ſervants unto Chriſt, and in exerciſing his power according to him, above the Church. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>We preach Chriſt, and our ſelves your ſervants for Chriſt;</hi> yet therein above them.

            <p>The Miniſters charge is to caſt the ſeed, the Elders duty is to enquire after the fruit in the husbandry of Chriſt; it is a ſad condition when a man hath ſuch a wound that he will not go to the Lord for help, becauſe he loves it; and will not have man to know it becauſe he is aſhamed of it; But you ſhall know it at the laſt day that the.

            <p>This I adde to anſwer that great queſtion in many ſcrupulous mindes. I cannot ſee (ſo ignorant) when an order is collected from the generall rules of the word; now this concluſion anſwers that doubt: For look as the maine work of men in place, is to promote publick good; (and hence pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-ſpirited men are to be choſen for it) ſo the principal rule is that which God and his Word gives them to walk by: whatever really doth tend to the advancement of that; Publiſh that, record that, and execute that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He is Gods Miniſter to

He is for mens private good, but 'tis in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to publick good; that as private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to attend their work, ſo publick perſons publick good. Hence, 1. If a law be made for publick hurt, that law is not of God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Hence, if the law be made only for the private good of themſelves, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, and hurts the publick, that's not according to God. Admirable was <hi>Joſhuas</hi> ſpirit herein, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19.49, 50.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If lawes be only in appearance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for publick good, and not really, they binde not; none muſt do evil, much leſſe make a law of it, for publick good. Nothing more uſuall then to make evill lawes and orders, croſſing Gods law, and to pretend publick good; which ever prove the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peſts and plagues, and cankers of that place, as <hi>Jeroboams</hi> command for Religion. Somethings are forbidden plainly, they make not for publick good, but hurt, <hi>the ſtatutes of Omri.</hi> Other things are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in their nature, as ſwine to go abroad, or to be ſhut up; but inconvenient in their uſe, and hurtful and ſcandalous, and that really to the generall. They are not for publick good, whatever is pretended; ſomethings are plainly commanded, they are for the publick good circumſtantiated; ſome things are indifferent in their nature, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169490:73"/>convenient and comfortable in their uſe, thoſe are indeed according to God. And ſuch things may be diſcerned, they are ſo obvious and ſenſible, of ſuch neceſſity and ſuch profit, when duly conſidered by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not blinded with their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>

Hence things indifferent, which may as well be left undone as done, and ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good no way advanced, are not of God that any ſhould reſtrain them: For the liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed by his blood, and which Gods law gives; no law of man can aboliſh, or take away. It's the cry of the claw-backs of Princes, that they have power in things indifferent, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch things which make as much for publick good, not to uſe, as uſe; the truth is, he hath leaſt power here; becauſe they are idle and Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes, no hurt, nor is there good in them: And hence, ſome of the moſt rigid School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men maintaine ſuch lawes binde not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: we are not to ſeek our private only; now all humane lawes are helps to ſeek publick.</p>

True, 1. If it were poſſible, all lawes for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169490:74"/>publick good, ſhould hurt no particular man, and Townſmen, if they can; ſhould help thoſe that are hurt; yet becauſe no lawes, but uſually they will preſſe on ſome mans particular; the heavieſt end of a ſtaffe that is to be borne, muſt fall on ſome mans ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſuch lawes muſt be made.

The law of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, a man is to do as he would be done by; there is no man, but if his good was advanced by the general, but would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that ſome particular ſhould be pinched. 3.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169490:74"/>though the law be not performed, becauſe the publick good in the minde of the Law-maker is known to be ſet forward that way as by obedience to the law. In theſe caſes penalty is enough; but if the law be mixt, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is a command it ſhall be done; and Law-giver is ſad, though penalty being paid, as being about a matter of weight; it may be the livelyhood and comfort of men, as keeping hogs out of corne, and peace in a town, that there be no complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; here the penalty will not ſatisfie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is no penall law, but a law indeed deducted from rules of the word of God; as it is in theft, he that ſteals, ſhall pay four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; or he that brawles, ſhall be duckt in the water: Suppoſe one ſhould ſay, I will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my ſervant to ſteal or revile; I hope 'tis no offence if he ſuffer the penalty. Yes, but it is, becauſe it is not a mecre penal law; the thing is of weight, peace between neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borus, ſo peace in a Town. It's a flat charge not to break it, and thou knowſt ſuch is the honeſty and juſtice of a Magiſtrate, that he will ſay, I would rather you would never do thus, then offer thoſe to do.

I have inſtanced the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars formerly, yet more diſtinctly. There be two great commands or charges of Chriſt, that ly upon all mens conſciences to whom the Goſpel comes, and therein lyes our ſervice of him generally: Which two I name, becauſe there we think we are free, or do not know our liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, The command of Chriſt is, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to whom the Goſpel comes, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169490:82"/>is preached, do believe, <hi>i.e.</hi> receive Chriſt Jeſus in all his fulneſſe in the Goſpel. <hi>John</hi> 1.12. For that is to believe; in which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand lies Gods offer. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.23. <hi>This is his commandment, that ye believe,</hi> John 6.25, 37, 38. <hi>This is the work of God that ye believe.</hi> Now here men think they are free. 1. They ſay they are unworthy; and hence they ſay, Depart from me, Lord, I am a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man; as if Gods grace was built on mans worthineſſe. 2. Becauſe unhumbled, whereas Gods grace calls in men unhumbled. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.17, 18. For Gods call and offer is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, though none but the humble wil heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to it. But there are none, but it may be ſaid to them; If they can believe, let them. 3. Becauſe Chriſt is not theirs, and are they bound to believe he is? Whereas the firſt act of faith, is not to believe Chriſt is mine, then men were bound to believe a lie. But to receive Chriſt as a woman her husband, that he may be mine by faith; and ſo a man may know and ſay, he is mine. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth no where ſay to any man, Chriſt is thine; but if thou receive him, he is thine, and conſequently the Spirit ſpeaks ſo alſo. 4. Becauſe they cannot believe, unleſſe they ſhould preſume; as if the Goſpel bound the conſcience of none to believe, but them that were able to believe it, and receive Chriſt in it; yet 'tis otherwiſe: for it bindes all to receive Chriſt Jeſus; to go up and poſſeſſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169490:82"/>him, to feed, eat and drinke, and live for ever. And I will leave this one undeniable argument; If men are liable to eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation at the great and laſt day, and to bear the eternal wrath of God and Chriſt alſo, for diſobeying the Goſpel, for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt and the offer of his grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Then thoſe mens conſciences are bound to obey the Goſpel; <hi>i. e.</hi> to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt now in this life. — But all that have the Goſpel preached to them, are liable to eternall condemnation, for diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it. <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Kiſſe the Son, leſt he be angry.</hi> So, 2 Theſſ. 2.8, 9. <hi>He comes to render vengeance on them that obey not the Goſpel.</hi> Rom. 2.16. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge the ſecrets of all hearts by my Goſpel.</hi> That is, whereever the Goſpel comes; for they that have no law, having no law ſhall not be judged by it: But men that have had the Goſpel, ſhall be judged by it, and therefore are bound o obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>The ſerious conſideration of which one truth, is enough to draw all to Chriſt from the power of unbelief; eſpecially they that ſay, I cannot, or ought not to believe. For the reaſon why men do not come, is.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. They think the Goſpel concerns not them; what doth the Lord ſay to me, come ſo vile, and ſinful? yes, that he doth; if there was no ſuch law, there
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169490:83"/>could be no tranſgreſſion or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. They think they ſhall preſume. No, if conſcience be bound to it, 'tis no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, to keep a Sabbath aright, or to receive Chriſt as God offers him: Oh, this quiets conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Lord layes his chain on the moſt, tender place of conſcience, as it will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it at the great day, or will have any peace; take heed, you refuſe not ſo great ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. 'Tis a chaine, not of bondage, but of liberty, and mercy, and love: Come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, not a Kingdome; but Chriſt, Peace, pardon, and grace freely; which may draw the heart, as it will at the great and laſt day. <hi>Come ye bleſſed, take a Kingdome;</hi> take a Chriſt prepared for you from before the foundation of the world. Oh that this might ſound in your eares: This is the firſt and cheifeſt; without this, all your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is hypocriſie, and abominable; but this will pleaſe, and then all poor obedience ſhall pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Love unto the whole will of Chriſt; eſpecially to that part of it, to love thoſe that be the members of Chriſt. Some Chriſtians they believe, and feeling a heart ſo croſſe to Chriſt, and the will of God; think they are from under the government of God and Chriſt, and ſo from under
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169490:83"/>the grace of Chriſt, (and the argument is ſtrong, if true;) but why not under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? becauſe they finde daily a ſpirit ſo croſſe to the will of Chriſt; and hence under continual fears of condemnation. Oh but conſider, haſt thou no love to the will of, Chriſt &amp; law of God? (for if any believe, this is found in him) if ſo, then under Chriſts Government. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>The Law of the spirit of life hath made me free.</hi> What is that Law? See <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.23, 24. Spirit of <hi>delight in the Law in the inner man,</hi> and mourning for contrary captivity. Know therefore, though you cannot do all; yet love the whole will of God, and mourn where you do not; and then ſay. Now no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Do not ſay, 'Tis impoſſible. Oh, here is mens wo, and triall of ſubjection to Chriſts will! How do you love it, love his Sabbaths and Ordinances, becauſe of his love to you? How do's this conſtrain you?</p>
            <p>In particular; Love the people of God, that is his ſpeciall commandment, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>John</hi> 13.34. But now the want here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or the contrary hereto: As when a man ſhall become: 1. A Diſtaſter. 2. A Contemner. 3. A Cenſurer, and whiſperer. 4. A Scoffer. 5. If met on a Bridge, an oppoſer of the Truths or ſervants of God. This is that which kindles wrath, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the inward venome of hypocriſie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169490:84"/>There's many duties neglected, and not that ſpirit of prayer, and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences amongſt Chriſtians; yet do you keep love to them; that what you cannot do your ſelves, yet you love others that can do it, and account it your bleſſedneſſe to be like them, and daily mourne under your neglects; that in every thing, the Goſpel is not adorned by you: and on the other ſide, although you have many duties, Sabbaths, and good acts; yet if not love, all is vile. I fear 'tis not mens joy, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, delight to hear the leaſt good word that falls from a good mans lips, but rather the truths and things of God deſpiſed; if ſo, then look for wo. And for Members of Chriſt, their lives not deſired, their deaths not lamented; but you know how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and are careleſſe though the Goſpel and God be ſlandered; you caſt off the Lords yoke. It was one mans ſpeech, that the great ſin of this Countrey will be hatred of the Saints, a ſcornful contempt of them; It will come by degrees, firſt diſtaſte, and then cenſure and contemne. Oh, but if herein you ſubmit, herein Chriſt is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Goſpel glorified in love and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe: Not in a rigorous auſterity of ſpirit, and diabolical cenſoriouſneſſe; but in word and deed, countenance and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, comforting and encouraging one another.</p>

               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:169490:84"/>When <hi>David</hi> would know what to do; <hi>Truely</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my goodneſſe extends not to thee; but to the Saints, in whom is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;</hi> Oh therefore ſubmit here; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience calls for, and Chriſt muſt have.</p>
            <p>To conclude with a word for help here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Means</hi> 1. Look to Gods Ordinances,<note place="margin">

An almighty power muſt overcome, and go on conquering, and to conquer. How ſhall we have this by Gods Ordinances? Some more principall, as Word and Sacraments; ſome leſſe. How ſhall we partake of this power in them? Look not on them in themſelves, but as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ſanctified, and ſo as glorious. And there pray and wait, and look for the power; nay, believe you ſhall receive this power. As the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> to <hi>Naaman;</hi> How did they cleanſe?

For this teſtimony of the Father is not the inward teſtimony of the ſpirit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Becauſe Chriſt ſpeaks of publick, and evident teſtimonies in this place; nor is it meant of the teſtimony of the Father in the Scripture; for that is a diſtinct teſtimony: and though the Father doth teſtifie of Chriſt in the Scriptures; yet 'tis not as his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, no more then the teſtimony of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of his works, whereby the Father did teſtifie alſo: Nor is it probable that our Saviour would at this time, omit that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous teſtimony of the Father at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; which if it be not here, is no where in this <hi>Chapter.</hi> Beſide, how is this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Fathers more then the Spirits; but then, being called his Son, he did evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare himſelf to be the Father that ſpake.

            <p>Now out Saviour in theſe words anſwers an <hi>Objection,</hi> which the Jewes (ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their own knowledge) might make. We know the Father as well as you; and yet we know no ſuch teſtimony that he

            <p>There is great need of trial of this, for a man may reade, hear and underſtand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, whatever another may; and yet the whole Scripture a ſealed book.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The voice of God ſingles a man out, and (though it be generally written or ſpoken) ſpeaks particularly to the very heart of a man, with a marvellous kinde of Majeſty and glory of God ſtamp't upon it; and ſhining in it.</p>
            <p>When a man heares things generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, the bleſſed eſtate or the Saints, the curſed eſtate of the wicked, conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the one, curſes to the other, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to faith and obedience, to both, and a man ſits by, and never thinks the Lord is now ſpeaking, and means me. Or if it doth ſo, yet thinks he intends me no more then others, he heares not the Lord ſpeaking; for when he ſpeaks, he ſpeaks particularly to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169490:92"/>the very heart of a man: he doth ſo fit the word to him, whether it be the Word of the law to humble him, or of Goſpel to comfort, or of command to guide, as if the Lord meant none but them.</p>
            <p>The word is like an exact picture, it looks every man in the face that looks on it, if God ſpeaks in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>It ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart, verſe</hi> 12. but <hi>verſe</hi> 13. he ſpeaks of God how comes that in? becauſe God, the Majeſty of God comes with it when God ſpeaks it; <hi>With whom we have to do,</hi> why is that put in? becauſe when the Lord ſpeaks, a man thinks now I have to do with God, if I reſiſt I oppoſe a God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this a man thinks he hath nothing to do with God, they are ſuch ſtrangers. Hence it is one man is wrought on in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, another not. God hath ſingled out one, not the other that day. Hence take a man unhumbled, he hears many things, and it may be underſtands not; if ſo, yet they concern not him; if they do, and conſcience is ſtir'd, yet they think man means them, and ſpeaks by hap, and others are as bad as they, and his trouble is not much. At laſt he heares his ſecret thoughts and ſins diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, all his life is made known, and thinks 'tis the Lord verily that hath done this; now God ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.35. thoſe things he did neither believe nor imagine; &amp;c <hi>John</hi> 4.29. <hi>See the man that hath told
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169490:93"/>me all that ever 1 did.</hi> Hence take a ſoul that is humbled, he heares of the free offer of grace, he refuſeth it; why, this is to all, and to hypocrites as well as to me. Apply any promiſe to it, it caſts by all, it looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as things generally ſpoken, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by man, but they hear not God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when the Lord comes, he doth ſo meet with their objections, and ſpeaks what they have been thinking may be true, that they think this is the Lord, this is to me. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.14. <hi>I'leſpeak to her heart:</hi> and hence 'tis called <hi>the ingraffed word,</hi> James 1.21. like one branch of many, applied to the ſtock, <hi>Job</hi> 33.14, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The voice of the Lord doth not only ſpeak particularly, but it goes further; it comes not only with an Almighty power, but with a certain everlaſting efficacy and power on the ſoul. Thus 'tis here, <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>Ye have not his word in you,</hi> they had it out of them; and not only in you, but abiding in you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>born of incorruptible ſeed,</hi> the Apoſtle ſeems to ſpeak of a kinde of birth by corruptible ſeed, and ſuch are like goodly flowers which ſoon wither, but you are born of incorruptible ſeed, which hath an eternal ſavour, ſweetneſſe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. of the foure grounds three of them fall away. <hi>John</hi> 15.16. Their fruit does not remain: they have ſome living affection at the preſent, but they go away
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169490:93"/>and it dies. Look but upon particulars, doth the Lord once ſpeak by the Word, and humble the heart? it never lifts up its head more; doth he reveal the glory of Chriſt? that light never goes out more. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4, 5. As at the firſt Creation, there was light, and ſo continues to this day; ſo doth he give life, <hi>John</hi> 11.26. Yon ſhall never die more; doth he give peace and joy? no man ſhall take their joy from them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>Fruit of Righteouſneſſe and Peace, and aſſurance for ever.</hi> Doth he give the Spirit of all theſe, which <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. comes by hearing of faith? it ſhall abide for ever, <hi>John</hi> 14.17.</p>
            <p>That look as Gods love is everlaſting, ſo his words have an everlaſting excellency and efficacy in them, and goodnes in them, the ſweeteſt token of his love: and as Chriſts purchaſe is only of eternal good things; ſo the application of this purchaſe by the Word, 'tis of eternal worth: peace, but peace eternal, life, light, favour, joy, but joy eternal; like muſtard ſeed, though very little, yet mighty in increaſe, and never ſubdued again; ſo that though it be but little, yet 'tis eternal: and hence obſerve where God hath ſpoken effectually, the longer the man lives, the more he growes in the vertue and power of the word; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other though wonderfully raviſhed for a time, yet dies, moſt commonly outwardly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169490:94"/>in external Profeſſion, but ever in inward ſavour; ſo that when you hear the word, and it moves you, affects you, and <hi>John is a burning light, and you rejoyce therein, but 'tis but for a ſeaſon.</hi> The evil Spirit comes on you, and <hi>David</hi> playes upon his Harp, and Miniſters preach ſweet things, but as ſoon as the Muſick is done, the evil Spirit returns, I ſay you never heard the Lords voice. The peace and joy of the Lord enters into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and the Apoſtle expreſly calls him an unfruitful hearer, <hi>James</hi> 1.24. <hi>that ſees his face and forgets himſelf.</hi> A gracious heart can ſay, This peace ſhall go to heaven; and joy, and love, and fear, it's part of eternal glory.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The voice of the Lord comes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus particularly, and with eternal effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, but with ſuch efficacy as carries unto, and centers in Chriſt; ſo 'tis here: <hi>For him whom God hath ſent you believe not. John</hi> 6.41. <hi>They ſhall be taught of God:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in doth that appear? <hi>the ſhall hear and learn ſo as to come to me;</hi> if the law humbles them, it's ſuch a humbling as drives them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, poor and undone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. if the Word gives peace to them, 'tis ſuch a peace which at the laſt they finde in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17, 18. with 14. if it live holily, it lives unto Chriſt, not meerly as to God, and to quiet conſcience, unto a Creator as <hi>Adam,</hi> but for Chriſts ſake. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>We judge
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169490:94"/>that if we were dead, and Chriſt died for us, we ſhould then live unto him;</hi> if they grow up by the word, 'tis in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. though Chriſt be not mentioned, yet it is ſtrange to ſee, let the word ſpeak what it will, whether terrour; Oh my need of Chriſt! mercy and grace; oh the love of Chriſt! oh the blood of Chriſt! Command; Oh that I may live to honour Chriſt, and wrong him no more! Duties; Oh the eaſie yoke of Chriſt! They look upon the whole Word rightly diſpenſed as the Bridegrooms voice, and truly his words are ſweet.</p>
            <p>For a man may have ſome ſuch feare, reformation, affection, as may continue, but never carry him out of himſelf unto Chriſt. The Phariſees knew the law, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exact even til their death, profited as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid he did; yet they had not the word abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them; becauſe not driven out of themſelves to Chriſt, to reſt there.</p>
            <p>Hence when men ſhall hear many things, but to what end do you heare, or what vertue have the things you hear? Do they only pleaſe fancy for a time? or do you hear to increaſe your knowledge and parts? or do you hear for cuſtome and company, and to quiet conſcience? or are you affected and ſunk, but not driven by all to lay thy head on Chriſt? the Lord never ſpake yet to thee; when the word hath laid you on this foundation, truly it's office is done and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169490:95"/>ended, Gods end is now attained, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Oh try your ſelves here, have you heard, but never heard the voice of the Lord, ruſhing upon thee with Majeſty, ſpeaking to thy hearty and the very ſecrets of it, but have ſaid, This is for others, and when you have thought the man hath ſpoken to you, your hearts have then ſwollen againſt him? or have you thus heard, but all dies and withers like flowers, the ſame heart ſtill? or have you had ſome powerful ſtroke which remaines, but it forceth you not out of your ſelves to Chriſt, there to reſt, there to joy, there to live, there to die? truly your time hath been ſpent in vain, you never yet heard the Lord ſpeak. Oh mourn for it, thou art ſtill in thy blood, if he never ſaid Live; in thy bondage, if the Lord never ſaid, Come forth. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of many to be lamented with teares. But if thou haſt thus heard particularly, and though bat little light, life and peace, yet it is of eternal efficacy, and all to draw thee to Chriſt; then bleſſe the Lord: <hi>For bleſſed are jour eares that hear,</hi> and I ſay as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Ask, if ever People heard God ſpeaking and live.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. makes it a greater matter to come to hear God on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and yet live; Bleſſed be God I live.</p>

The Word is compared, you know, to ſeed, and that in this reſpect; the ſeed it is caſt under the clod in the winter-time, and it hath a vertue in it to grow; but it is hid, and comes not to blade of a good while; and when it doth blade, yet it beares not fruit of a long time: So here, the Lord may caſt the ſeed of his Word into the heart; but it is hidden for a time, it is not felt as yet, but there it is; a word of threatning, a word of promiſe, a word of Command; a man may caſt it by, and ſay, It belongs not to me; a man may ſlight the command for a time: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Lord having caſt his ſeed into the heart; it ſhall ſpring up. As many a childe, the father ſpeaks to it, and applies the word home to it, when it is of ſome years; the childe regards it not: But now ſtay ſome time, till the Lord do bring it into ſome ſad affliction; now a man begins to think, I remember what my father ſpake to me once, &amp; I regarded it not then:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169490:96"/>Now this ſeed which was caſt when the childe was young, it ſhall ſpring up twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after. <hi>John.</hi> 2.22. Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>He would destroy the Temple, and raiſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in three dayes:</hi> Now <hi>when he was riſen from the dead, his diſciples remembred that which he had ſpoken to them,</hi> but they regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not before; <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>have I ſpoken to you whiles I was with you; but when the comforter is come, he ſhall bring all theſe words to your remembrance that I have ſaid unto you.</hi> One ſentence it may be that hath diſcovered a mans ſin, it lyes hid; but when the time of ripening drawes near, you ſhall ſee the word will have marvelous increaſe; and that ſin it may be will bring to minde twenty ſins; and that promiſe of God which gives but a little conſolation, conſider'd in it ſelf, it ſhall give marvelous conſolation. One would wonder to ſee what one word will do, when the Lods time of bleſſing it is come.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. After that a Chriſtian hath had the feeling of the efficacy of the word, he may loſe the feeling of it again, and yet the being of it may remain; and the reaſon is this, partly becauſe there is not alwayes need of feeling the like efficacy in the word. A man may have by the word a marvelous deal of aſſurance of Gods love, and ſenſe of mercy and joy in the holy Ghoſt, he may have this in the feeling of it: This word, it did ly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169490:96"/>hid for a time; afterward it ſprings up and gives him peace. But he loſes his peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, his Sun do's ſet, and it is midnight with him within twenty four hours, and he is as much in the dark as before; Now the being of this peace is there, but he hath no need of the feeling of it at all times; the Lord he will reſerve that till ſome time of tentation, that he ſhall meet withall. As <hi>Paul,</hi> he had marvelous Revelations; but <hi>Paul</hi> had more need of humiliation, then exaltation; and there was not that uſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> having thoſe glorious manifeſtations to him; <hi>I will glory in my infirmities:</hi> There was need for <hi>Paul</hi> to know the evils of his heart, that he might walk humbly; and it did not make ſo much for the glory of the Lord, as this that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay; I have this miſery and darkneſſe, and ſins, and yet Jeſus Chriſt he will take away all: There was not need for <hi>Paul</hi> to have thoſe joyes at all times, that he had at one time. So the Lord he gives a Chriſtian joy and peace, now there is no need for a Chriſtian to have it alwayes. <hi>I will pour floods of water on dry ground:</hi> Beloved, if there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but raine, raine every day and night, the ground would be glutted with raine, and ſo turned into a puddle; but when the land is dry and thirſty, now the ground hath need of raine: Let the Earth make uſe of that raine it hath: and when it is dry and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169490:97"/>thirſty, I will give more, ſaith the Lord. So the Lord he gives the ſoul joy and peace; Now, if it ſhould continue, the very peace and joy of God, would not be pleaſant to the ſoul; or at leaſt, not ſo pleaſant as it will be, when the Lord takes it away, and gives it the ſoul again. A Chriſtian comes to the meeting-houſe, and the Lord fills the ſailes of a poor ſoul, that he wonders the Lord ſhould meet him, and ſpeak ſo ſuitably to him: But as ſoone as he is gone out again, this is the complaint of the ſoul, all is loſt again; now the ſoul it falls a mourning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It is not for the glory of God to give the ſoul ſuch peace out of his Ordinances, as he doth in them; the ſoul it would not prize the Ordinances of the Lord ſo much; yet there it is; and when they come again, the Lord, he either gives them the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings again, or elſe there is a new ſpring.</p>

The eternall efficacy of the word and voice of God; it may be preſerved in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſpirit of prayer, for the continuance of it while a man hath it, and for the return of it when it is loſt. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.4, 5. <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. David</hi> he knew his own weakneſſe; yet he intimates with what power it came on his heart: <hi>Oh! that my ſoul were directed to keep thy ſtatutes;</hi> When the ſoul ſees the beauty of a command, and the good will of God,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169490:97"/>how ſweet it is, and how amiable the way and work of God is, <hi>Oh that my heart were directed to keep thy ſtatutes.</hi> And ſo when it is gone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, that I may ſee thy glory and power, as I have ſeen thee in thy ſanctuary.</hi> He doth not ſay, that I may ſee thy glory and power in thy ſanctuary, though that might be too; no, but <hi>that I may ſee thy glory and power, as I have ſeen thee in thy ſanctuary. David</hi> he did finde a want of ſeeing him as he had done; yet the vertue of it did remaine in a ſpirit of thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſire; <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for thee, as in a dry land where no water is, that I may ſee thee.</hi> A Chriſtian may have at ſometime ſuch a glimpſe (in hearing the word) of Gods grace, of the exceeding riches of Gods grace, and the love of God to him, that he may be in a little heaven at that time, raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the admiration of that mercy, that ever God ſhould look to him. It is ſo, and the word ſayes ſo, and the ſoul is raviſhed with wonderment at it; yet God is gone again, and the ſoul loſes it. Now the ſoul thinks, I have loſt the efficacy of Gods word, but it is not ſo; for thus it may be preſerved. Oh that I may ſee this God as I have done: And all his life-time the ſoul may finde the want of this, and yet it may be preſerved in a ſpirit of prayer. For whom the Lord hath given once a glimpſe of his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169490:98"/>glory; the ſoul it cannot be at reſt, but it breatheth for more of that mercy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; a Chriſtian may finde his ſpirit mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly refreſhed at the word, he may taſte how good the Lord is, and he may loſe it again: but this may be preſerved in a ſpirit of longing after this God, and preſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And I will ſay this, Brethren, A Chriſtian may finde no good by the word to his apprehenſion; he ſees the admirable bleſſed eſtate of the Saints, and exceeding riches of God in Chriſt, ſees the ſwetneſſe of the wayes of God; goes home and thinks within himſelf, Happy they that are in this condition: Bleſſed are they that can walk thus with God; But I cannot, ſaith the ſoul. I ſay it may finde it thus, when he cannot finde the reall efficacy of the word as he would do; he may receive the benefit of that word, if the Lord do but only give him a heart to deſire it. Oh that the Lord would but thus manifeſt himſelf to me; the ſoul may go away poor and hungry from the word, and the Lord may yet reſerve a ſpirit of thirſting after that good which a man deſires to finde; and there is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the word there.</p>
            <p>As now there are two golden veſſels; one a man fills, and it is everyday dropping, and he preſerves it; another veſſel he do's not fil, but with ſomething that he hath, he is every day widening of it. So ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169490:98"/>the Lord he's a filling of them; others, the Lord he do's not fill them with ſuch peace and joy; ay, but though the Lord is not filling of them, he is a widening of them: there is ſuch a vertue that the lord do's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the heart; with ſecret deſires and longings after more of Gods grace, and Chriſts: The Lord he ſaith, I intend to make this man a veſſel of glory; and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he ſhall have a great deal of glory and peace at the laſt. The lord he leaves ſuch an impreſſion of the word upon him, as that thereby he enlargeth the heart; <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi>

            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. A Chriſtian may have the everlaſting efficacy of the word and voice of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a ſpirit of thankfulneſſe and love to the Lord, for thoſe joyes and good that it findes by the word ſometimes. When it feels that the ſweet and ſavour of the word is gone, a ſpirit of thankfulneſſe and love to the word that doth remaine; The Lord he preſerves the efficacy of the word in this way. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.7. <hi>I ſhall,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, then praiſe thee with uprightneſſe of heart, when I ſhall have learned thy righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The Lord he may teach his people his righteous judgements; and the ſavour and feeling, and ſtrength of them to their feeling may be gone, and yet it is preſerved in a ſpirit of thankfulneſſe and praiſe that ever the Lord ſhould ſhew it ſuch mercy.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169490:99"/>When the Spirit is gone, the ſpirit of love and thankfulneſſe remaines. As now a man hath heard the word, the Lord he hath effectually wrought on him, and changed his heart, and drawn him to himſelf; a Chriſtian it may be he may loſe thoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and humiliations, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thoſe things; yet there remaineth to his dying day this Spirit, he bleſſeth God, and wondereth at God, that ever he ſhould make the word effectual; that he ſhould leave ſo many thouſands in the world, and caſt his skirt over him, and ſay to him, Live; this do's remain ſtill.</p>
            <p>Brethren, the Lord do's ſometimes let light into a mans minde to diſcover his ſin: now this light it do's not ſenſibly overcome the power of ſinne: But now the ſoul bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God for that word which hath convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it; had I never ſeen my ſinne, ſaith the ſoul, I ſhould never a ſought for power a-againſt it, and pardon of it; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues now, and cannot but continue; here is the efficacy of the word, the word of Gods grace; though the flower of it be gone, yet there is an eternal power of the word; that the ſoul can ſay, It hath come to me, and helped me againſt theſe ſins; and the ſoul wonders at the Lord, it ſhould be ſo much as it is. So again, a Chriſtian he findes marvelous refreſhings and affection whiles he is a hearing; when he is gone away, he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169490:99"/>findes not the ſame, but he bleſſeth God for thoſe affections he findes, and there remains an eternall efficacy of the word.</p>

The eternall efficacy of the word, it may be and is preſerved, by nouriſhing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and reſtoring the new man that is eternall. There is a double efficacy that the word hath; the firſt is to beget a Chriſtian to life, and this new man is eternall. I conceive all the actions of the new man may be ſuſpended, and the increaſings of the new creature may be decayed, though God doth renew it again: But this never do's decay, it never dies: <hi>He that is born of God cannot ſin, becauſe he is borne of God; and becauſe the ſeed of God remaines in him.</hi>

There is efficacy in the word when it hath begotten a man to nouriſh him up; and ſo the word it is food to him, that was ſeed to him to beget him, which food is eternal. How is it eternal? Is it in this, that now the ſweetneſſe, ſavour and remembrance of every thing that doth refreſh him, ſhall laſt in it ſelf? No, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in this reſpect it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, in that it leaveth its ſecret vertue in the nouriſhing of that which is eternall.

The eternal efficacy of the word may be preſerved in a power of Conflict againſt the power of ſin: for therein the Lords power of the Word does principally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this life, though not in a power of victory, I mean a compleat victory, yet an imperfect and incompleat victory, there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is firſt or laſt, whereever there is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Conflict. I mean thus, the Word it ſingles a man out, and ſpeaks to his heart, and ſets him at variance with his ſin, and with himſelf for his ſin, and he joynes ſide with God in the uſe of all meanes, that his unbelieving heart and proud Spirit may be ſubdued; it ſets him at variance with his ſin; now there is many a Chriſtian thinks there is no power of the Word: oh my unbelief continues ſtill, and my vain minde, and I can finde little ſtrength; no, ye muſt not look for a power of compleat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169490:101"/>but yet there is a power of Conflict; God he ſets the ſoul at an everlaſting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with his ſin, never to be reconciled, and looks to the Lord, that by his Word and Spirit he would ſubdue them, that ſo he may ſee the death of them, and he ſides with the Lord in the uſe of all means, comes to the Word, and comes to Prayer, and ſayes, Speak againſt my ſin, Lord; Lord, waſte theſe diſtempers: and ſo the ſoul is thus at variance with his ſin, although his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do get winde and hill of him, he goes again, and to them again: and though he periſheth, and never have mercy from the Lord; yet, Lord, that I may never ſin againſt thee more, help therefore, Lord, by this promiſe, and mercy and meanes; and here he keeps him, and here he holds. Truly, brethren, here is an eternal vertue, and ſuch a vertue as no hypocrites have, that have ſome ſting of conſcience, and after they have ſome peace, they are at truce with their ſins. No, there is an everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and warfare, and I do aſſure you there is an everlaſting power gone forth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 20. <hi>Chriſt will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax, till judgement come to victory;</hi> Therefore there may be judgement, but it may not come to victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there may be ſmoak and fire, and it may almoſt go out, and he Lord he blowes it up again, and at the laſt, though it be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169490:101"/>weak and little, and he think with himſelf he ſhall never get ſtrength again, yet the Lord will give victory in his time.</p>
            <p>Only becautious here; I told you there is an incompleat victory, the Lord never ſets his people at variance with their ſin, but they have victory, but it is an incompleat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Saith the Lord, <hi>I will drive out the Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and Canaanitess, and Perizzites before you, but I will do it by little and little.</hi> There is many a Chriſtian that findes within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Spirit of warfare againſt his ſin, and did he examine himſelf, he ſhould finde a Spirit of victory; but he thinks he hath none becauſe his victory is not compleat. If he had a heart ſo to believe as never to doubt more, and ſuch quickning as never to be dead more, never to depart from God more, now I ſhould think the Word comes with power; but I finde that theſe evils prevaile againſt me. There is many a one does ſcorn the kindneſſe of Chriſt, becauſe he findes not compleat victory, but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe remaines ſtill, and ſinful luſts remaine ſtill, therefore the Word doth me no good at all, ſaith he. The Lord he hath given thee a Spirit of Conflict, and hath ſet thee at an everlaſting diſtance with thy ſin, and he doth give thee ſome victory. Beloved, a Chriſtian may decay in the power of the grace of Chriſt, which he hath, received from the Word, and voice of God in the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169490:102"/>Word, and he may decay and grow to a very low eſtate; yet be ſhall finde this, the Word of the Lord hath come with power to him, it will recover his ſoul again, and ſo the efficacy of the Word is eternal. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. its ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>his People ſhall feare him ſo long as Sun and Moon ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,</hi> that is, continually, all their life-time. It may be ſaid, there he many that finde decay of their ſervice and obedience, and they loſe their feare of the Lord, and their dread, and their humble walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>He ſhall come as the raine on the mowen graſſe:</hi> many times a Chriſtian hath his flouriſhing time as the graſſe, but when the graſſe is mowen, it is as a dry chip; ſo the ſoul it may grow dry, as dry as a chip. Now where is your ſap and ſavour? but I tell you, if you belong to the Lord Jeſus, the raine it will fall again, the Word of God ſet on by the Spirit of Chriſt, it ſhall fall up. on you as the raine on the mowen graſſe, and you know that it recovers little by little, and puts on a green coat again.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169490:102"/>in external hearing, and with ſome little movings, and affections, and ſtirrings of the Word of Gods grace in hearing. Let not the Word be to you as the ſound of many waters, and a noiſe, no efficacy of the Word that do remaine on your ſoules. Brethren and beloved in Chriſt, I lay my finger on the ſore in theſe times. Oh the contempt of the Goſpel of Chriſt, though I believe it hath its efficacy in the heart of the Elect: that is the thing that I preſſe, never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with external hearing, though thou mayeſt have ſome affection, and know new things, unleſſe thou finde the Lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an eternal efficacy to thy ſoul. I conceive two things are to be done, that the word may come with an everlaſting ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy; although ſomething is to be done by Miniſters; that is, to preach truth, and Goſpel-truth, fetch't from heaven wich many prayers, and ſoaked truth with many teares. <hi>Ye ſhall know the truth, and that truth ſhall make you free.</hi> Convicting truth. <hi>We preach,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit. The Spirit of God when he cometh, he convinceth the world of ſin.</hi> Let Miniſters do ſo. Preach convincing truth and Goſpel-truth, fetch'd from heaven, and bathed in teares. Oh brethren, let the fire burn clear, let there not be more ſmoake then fire, it will never come with power then; convincing Goſpel-truth,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169490:103"/>ſet on by the demonſtration of the Spirit of the Lord, and this will ſet a Chriſtian at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; there is never ſuch a Sermon that the faithful ones of God preach to you; if it come not with a power to looſen you and call you home; it comes with a power to blinde you: it is <hi>an axe at the root of the trees;</hi> but I leave this. What means ought the people to uſe, that the Word of God may come with efficacy?</p>
            <p>Them that are in their unregenerate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, the Lord only knowes how to work on their hearts; they muſt come to the outward meanes. I ſpeak to the Saints of God, I leave others to the infinite mercy of the Lord; <hi>It is not in him that willeth or runneth, but in the Lord that ſheweth mercy.</hi> In the uſe of meanes.</p>

Do not only ſee thy infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and weakneſſe, but pray to God to give thee a heart bleeding under the ſenſe of thy many infirmities. Many times men ſlight them, and are not ſenſible of them; I do not ſay wickedneſſes and wilfulneſſes, but thy infirmities and weakneſſes, get a heart mourning under them. A Chriſtian is made up of infirmities and weakneſſes, a man would not think there is that in another, which he knowes by himſelf. Oh brethren, labour for a broken heart in the ſenſe of your many infirmities and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, darkneſſe and enmity, vanity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavourineſſe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169490:103"/>the Lord will have his time to ſpeak to ſuch a ſoul. <hi>Break up the fallow ground of your hearts, — leſt my wrath break out with fire:</hi> the Lord hath promiſed <hi>to dwell with the poor and contrite.</hi> Look as it was with our Saviour Chriſt, they brought the ſick and the lame ones to him, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue went but from Chriſt to heal them all.

We are far from God, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear him: draw near to him when you come to the external Word, when you come to heare the Word, heare it as the voice of God; <hi>You heard the Word at the Word of God,</hi> which you felt in you.<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.3</note> I do not ſpeak that the ſoule ſhould take every thing that Miniſters ſpeak as the Word of God, but that which is the Word of God, take it as God ſpeaking. I am not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the infinite unknown ſweetneſſe, and mercy, and preſence of God, that you ſhall finde thus coming. I know it is a common truth, but I am not aſhamed to tell you, I have not for many a year under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this truth, and I ſee but little of it yet; ye have heard of it, but ye do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it is to hear God ſpeaking. When God hath an intent to harden a

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Do not truſt to the external word. It is a heaven on earth to hear the Word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, a glorious thing to hear the Word of God as Gods Word; but truſt to the free grace of God in it, and the Spirit of God in Chriſt to ſet on that Word. When they brought the lame, and blinde, and halt to Chriſt, they looked for the Word and the Power of it; <hi>Speak the Word, Lord, and thy ſervants ſhall be whole;</hi> ſo bring your blinde, lame, and halt ſoules to Chriſt, and truſt to the free grace of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>The Work of the Lord it ſhall proſper in his hand;</hi> ſo the Word of the Lord it ſhall proſper in his hand alſo.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſo ſeek the Lord, and ſo heare the Word, ſo ſeek the truth, and ſo hear the truth, as that you lay up your happineſſe in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169490:104"/>this world, in cloſing with the truth and with the word. Brethren, what is a mans happineſſe in heaven, but to cloſe with God and Chriſt? I cannot come to God now, the moſt that I can have of God now is in his word; if it be happineſſe in heaven to cloſe with God in Chriſt, truly then it is a mans happineſſe to cloſe with God in his word on earth; and if it be your happineſſe, lay up your happineſſe in it. <hi>My ſon,</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>if thou wilt hear my word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 3.</note> 
               <hi>let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the middeſt of thy heart;</hi> place thy happineſſe in them. <hi>So ſhall they be life to thy ſoul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 22.</note> Nevertheleſſe Brethren, let a mans ſoul be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing in the world, when he comes to hear, beſides the word; if he lay not up his happineſſe in cloſing with the word; truely, the word it will be like a ſong to him. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells them, <hi>Their hearts were gone after their covetouſneſſe:</hi> When a man comes to hear a Sermon, there is a Sermon and the Market, there is a Sermon and a friend to ſpeak withall; and ſo many young people will go abroad to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; What is the end of it? It is, that ye may get wives and husbands many of you; but it is not your bleſſedneſſe to cloſe with the Lord in his word. I have known ſome men that have had a diſtaſte againſt the truth of the Lord; and I have known them
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169490:105"/>for many a day, they have not been able to underſtand the truth of the Lord. When it ſhall be thus with a man, that a mans heart is ſet on ſomething elſe beſides the word of the Lord, that it is not my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to cloſe with the truth of the Lord; ſuch a man ſhall never underſtand the truth of the Lord. Though the word be ſweet to you ſometimes, if your bleſſedneſſe do not lye in this, to enjoy God; Oh this Goſpel of God, and theſe Commands of God, that your bleſſedneſſe do not lye in cleaving to the Lord in his word; I ſay, it is a certain truth, you ſhall be blinded and hardned by the word: For here is a Rule; Whatſoever a mans heart is ſet on, as his chiefeſt good, the preſence of that good it comes with power: So here, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Goſpel of Chriſt, when the preſence of it commands the heart, nothing is good enough for it, and it cloſeth with it, and with Chriſt in it.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore, Beloved in Chriſt, ſet upon the uſe of theſe meanes, think within your ſelves; What if the Lord had left me without the word? I will tell you what ye would have been. Look upon theſe poor <hi>Indians,</hi> herds of Beaſts; look upon others on their Ale-benches, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Lord, ſuch a one thou hadſt been.</p>
            <p>This bleſſed word and woice of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169490:105"/>very tittle of it coſt the blood of Chriſt; written all the lines of it in the blood of Chriſt. Oh, make much of it, and it will make much of you; it will comfort you, and ſtrengthen you, and revive you; and if the word come not with power, ye ſhall be under the power of ſomething elſe; if not under the power of the word, then under the power of ſome luſt. What is the reaſon that theſe poor creatures, that are come to the tryall for life and death, that have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſuch ſins as were never heard of? What is the reaſon that they are under the power of their luſts? I will tell you what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſon, if wiſdome enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart, and diſcretion be pleaſant to thy ſoul, it ſhall keep thee from the ſtrange woman,</hi> &amp; ſinful companion. If it be pleaſant, here is the reaſon, the word of Gods grace it never came with power, or if it came with power, powerleſs the word of Gods grace hath been to them; and becauſe it hath not come with power, the Lord he hath given them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the power of their luſts, and ſinfull diſtempers. Oh Brethren, truely I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how any man can maintaine any evidence of Gods electing love; that ſhall hear and hear, and good dayes mend him not, nor bad dayes paire him: that can commend a Sermon, and ſpeak of it; but that efficacy is not known to him, neither doth he mourne for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169490:106"/>the want of it; but the eternall effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof is a ſtranger to it. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Knowing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>your election of God;</hi> How did he know it? For ſaith he, <hi>Our Goſpel came not to you in word, but in power;</hi> ye will rejoyce the hearts of your Miniſtets, when the word comes with power. Let me ſay this, and ſo I conclude.</p>
            <p>I remember the Lords threatning; <hi>I will take away the ſtaffe of bread, and ye ſhall eat, and ſhall not be ſatisfied;</hi> When the Lord ſhall let men have the word, when the Lord ſhall not take away the word, but the ſtaffe of the word. Suppoſe you poor Parents, Fathers, and Mothers; your families ſhould have good Corne, but when you come to eat it, no ſtrength at all, but ye dye and weare away; and others that are about you, they have planted the ſame Corne, and eat and are ſatisfied; What will ye do in this caſe? You would ſet apart a day of faſting and prayer; and ſay, Good Lord, what a curſe is upon me? my poor children are dying before me, others have the ſtaffe of Corne; but my Family have no ſtrength at all. Ye would mourne if it were thus with your poor Cattell. Oh, for poor Creatures to have the word, but the efficacy of it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; no bleſſing, no power at all.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169490:106"/>Oh poor Creatures, go and ſay! Oh the the curſe of God that lyes on me, the wrath of God that lyes on my ſervants, it is a heavy plague. But Oh the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and excellency of it, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhall finde everlaſting vertue and efficacy conveyed to him by the word.</p>
            <p>All you that are before the Lord this day, ye ſhall ſee an end of all perfection; but eternall things are not they worth ſomething? You ſhall ſee an end of all delights and contentments; but this ſhall comfort you when you are a dying, that the word which you attended upon the Lord in, ſuch peace, and ſuch conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have found by it; and the efficacy of that word then remaines with you; nay, goes to heaven with you. <hi>I commend you therefore to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up unto an eternall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance amongſt them that are ſanctified,</hi> Acts 20.32.</p>
